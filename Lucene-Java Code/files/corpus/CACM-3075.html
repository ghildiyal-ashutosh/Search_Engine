fast parallel sorting algorithms a parallel bucket sort algorithm is presented that requires time o log n and the use of n processors the algorithm makes use of a technique that requires more space than the product of processors and time a realistic model is used model is used in which no memory contention is permitted a procedure is also presented to sort n numbers in time o k log n using n 1 1 k processors for k an arbitrary integer the model of computation for this procedure permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory location cacm august 1978 hirschberg d parallel processing sorting algorithms bucket sort 3 74 4 34 5 25 5 31 ca780803 dh february 7 1979 10 25 am 2714 4 3075 3075 4 3075 3075 4 3075 3075 4 3075 3075 4 3075 3085 4 3075 3156 4 3075 2289 5 3075 2557 5 3075 2664 5 3075 2714 5 3075 3075 5 3075 3075 5 3075 3075 5 3075 3156 5 3075 2289 6 3075 2973 6 3075 3075 6 3075
