operations on sparse relations various computations on relations boolean matrices or directed graphs such as the computation of precedence relations for a context free grammar can be done by a practical algorithm that is asymptotically faster than those in common use for example how to compute operator precedence or wirth weber precedence relations in o n 2 steps is shown as well as how to compute linear precedence functions in o n 2 steps is shown as well as how to compute linear precedence functions in o n steps where n is the size of a grammer the heart of the algorithms is a general theorem giving sufficient conditions under which an expression whose operands are sparse relations and whose operators are composition transitive closure union and inverse can be computed efficiently cacm march 1977 hunt h b iii szymanski t g ullman j d computational complexity sparse relation boolean matrix directed graph wirth weber precedence relation linear precedence function slr grammar t canonical precedence relation 4 12 5 23 5 25 ca770306 jb december 29 1977 8 05 am 1542 4 2986 1683 4 2986 1693 4 2986 1781 4 2986 1787 4 2986 1836 4 2986 1945 4 2986 2060 4 2986 2061 4 2986 2082 4 2986 2091 4 2986 2152 4 2986 2179 4 2986 2221 4 2986 2340 4 2986 2340 4 2986 2340 4 2986 2356 4 2986 2546 4 2986 2603 4 2986 2698 4 2986 2708 4 2986 2733 4 2986 2824 4 2986 2824 4 2986 2824 4 2986 2982 4 2986 2982 4 2986 2982 4 2986 2986 4 2986 2986 4 2986 2986 4 2986 2986 4 2986 2986 4 2986 3045 4 2986 3093 4 2986 3093 4 2986 3094 4 2986 1491 5 2986 1683 5 2986 1836 5 2986 2179 5 2986 2340 5 2986 2986 5 2986 2986 5 2986 2986 5 2986
