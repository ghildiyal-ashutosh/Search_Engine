a formac program for the solution of linear boundary and initial value problems a computer program is described which has been developed for obtaining approximate solutions to linear initial and boundary value problems involving differential equations for each problem input to the program includes 1 the equations in symbolic form to be satisfied the differential equations equations describing auxiliary conditions such as boundary conditions etc 2 a numerical description of the regions in which each of the equations are to be satisfied 3 sets of functions in symbolic form to be used in linear combinations to approximate the solution functions give the above input the program generates an approximation to the solutions of the specified problemm in terms of the specified functions which is optimum in the least squares sense cacm august 1966 cuthill e ca660814 es march 17 1982 10 10 am 1396 5 3200 3200 5 3200 3200 5 3200 3200 5 3200 964 6 3200 1028 6 3200 1029 6 3200 1083 6 3200 1132 6 3200 1214 6 3200 1278 6 3200 1334 6 3200 1365 6 3200 1386 6 3200 1387 6 3200 1388 6 3200 1392 6 3200 1393 6 3200 1394 6 3200 1395 6 3200 1396 6 3200 1397 6 3200 1496 6 3200 284 6 3200 407 6 3200 3199 6 3200 3200 6 3200 3201 6 3200 3202 6 3200 3203 6 3200 3204 6 3200 561 6 3200 730 6 3200
