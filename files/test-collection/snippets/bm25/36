space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors

in this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors

************************
.  two new hash-coding methods are examined
and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method.
the computational factors considered are the size of the hash area
(space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the 
given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.  the new methods 
are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded 
information from that associated with conventional methods.  the reduction in 
space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of 
errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, 
applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core

hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  in such 
applications, it is envisaged that overall performance
could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in
conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some
secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small
fraction of errors associated with new methods.  an example is discussed
which illustrates possible areas of application for the new
methods.  analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing

a model for a multifunctional teaching system

a teaching system model that was incorporated
into an operating system of a large computer 
is described.  the model transferred control to the
operating system to execute functions other than 
teaching, and then recovered control in order to resume
teaching.  the teaching system (abac-ii) was 
written to run under the operating system (ibsys) for
the ibm 7044 graphic system.  because the teaching 
system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself,
a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray 
display terminal could switch readily between student
mode and programmer mode.  during the latter, the 
full resources of the operating system (language processors,

(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  to explore the prospects 
************************
.  to explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer

idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  a program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 the authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic

for snobol4.  a block is a three-dimensional 
aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped,
best thought of as a three-dimensional 
extension to a string.  (the third dimension is used for
overstriking.)  blocks may be printed, concatenated 
in any of three dimensions, and merged on the basis
of program-defined connection points.  some blocks 
adapt in size and shape to their environment.  blocks
and their operations are mainly used for composing 
printable output.  a variety of graphical problems (including
flowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams, 
mathematical-equation formation, and text justification
and preparation) have been programmed on a printer 
in what appears to be an easy and natural way.  in addition
to these somewhat specialized applications, 
blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independent
output formation mechanism especially suitable 
for nonnumerical work.  the concept of a block is largely
language independenthat is, blocks require 
little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily
be absorbed into the external structure of

logic and programming languages

logic has been long in terested in whether answers
to certain questions are computable in principle, 
since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of
formalization.  more recently, precise comparisons 
in the efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 these, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  what is a machine?
 what is a computable process?  how (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 the definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 so far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  it would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  these levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.

how to keep the addresses short

an algorithm is presented for minimizing the
sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced 
by an assembler or compiler when (1) the length of
each computer instruction is assumed to be either 
"long" or "short" ("long," if the memory location addressed
is more than a predetermined distance from 
the current location; "short," otherwise), and (2)
there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings 
(origins) are separated by prespecified amounts. for example,
some computers permit either 8-bit addressing 
(interpreted relative to the location counter) or full
16-bit addressing of all of memory.  when assembling 
or compiling two or more blocks of instructions which
have many mutual references in such a computer, 
there is no simple iterative procedure for keeping
as many of the addresses short as possible.  this

this type can be formulated as

a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems

an encryption method is presented with the novel
property that publicly revealing an encryption 
key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key.  this has two important consequences: (1) 
couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit
keys, since a message can be enciphered using 
an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient.
 only he can decipher the message, since 
only he knows the corresponding decryption key.  (2)
a message can be "signed" using a privately held 
decryption key.  anyone can verify this signature using
the corresponding publicly revealed encryption 
key.  signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot
later deny the validity of his signature.  this 
has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic
funds transfer" systems.  a message is 
encrypted by representing it as a number m, raising
m to a publicly specified power e, and then taking 
the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly
specified product, n, of two large secret prime 
numbers p and q.  decryption is similar;only a different,
secret, power d is used, where e * d = 1 (mod(p-1) 
* (q-1)).  the security of the system rests in part on
the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, 
n.

a pl/i program to assist the comparative linguist

a practical pl/i program is described which
can assist comparative linguists to determine
the regular sound correspondences between genetically related languages.
the investigator must arrange data for input by aligning pairs
of suspected cognates.  the program tabulates the correspondences,
and uses list processing techniques to sort and count them.
each pair of words is then assigned a relative value that is a function

the nucleus of a multiprogramming system

this paper describes the philosophy and structure of a multiprogramming system 
that can be extended with a hierarchy of operating systems to suit diverse

are handled uniformly as parallel, cooperating process

most current programming languages treat computation
over different classes of objects (e.g. 
numbers, strings, labels and functions).  for correct
compilation and execution, the following question 
then arises: is a program properly constructed so that
its operations and operands are compatible?  the 
activity of answering this question is usually called
type checking.  this paper attempts

notions of abstraction and application of functions. 
in particular, a program is mapped into an expression 
within a decidable subset of the lambda calculus, which
characterizes the type relations within the program 
and eliminates all other information.  the determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".  an application 
to type checking in algol 60 is made, and the attendant
problems faced for any notion of type checking 
are discussed.

toward a discipline of real-time programming

programming is divided into three major categories
with increasing complexity of reasoning 
in program validation: sequential programming, multiprogramming,
and real-time programming.  by adhering 
to a strict programming discipline and by using a suitable
high-level language molded after this discipline, 
the complexity of reasoning about concurrency and execution
time constrain ts may be drastically reduced. 
 this may be the only practical way to make real-time
systems analytically verifiable and ultimately 
reliable.  a possible discipline is outlined and

a record and file partitioning model

one of the main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  this paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each

length data-items.  the probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
the file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  one of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  the model that is presented in

signature simulation and certain cryptographic codes

three cyphers allegedly authored by thomas
jefferson beale in 1822 have been the subject of 
intensive study for over 100 years.  generations of
cryptanalysts have expended untold man-years, thus 
far without success, attempting tode code them; vast armies
of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have 
devoted herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills
of virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza. 
 the history of pertinent activities would fill volumes,
yet serious students of cryptography have always 
had nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity.
 it has been alleged that the "known solution" to 
cypher number two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49,...("i
have deposited in the county of bedford about 
four miles from buford's in an excavation or vault...")
with the aid of an unsanitized version of the 
declaration of independence was merely a superb, imaginative,
and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago 
for whatever reasons.  modern computer technology could
obviously perform signature analyses the process 
of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper
insights into their construction.  for the benefit 
of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the
second cypher employs a specified document whose 
words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters
of these words are sought out at random to 
match the letters of these words are sought out at random
to match the letters of the clear text or message. 
 the sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches
is then written down as the final code.  while 
primitive, the process has the advantage of relative
security until the source document becomes known; 
at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second
graders.  the work now completed with the help 
of our univac 1108 includes numerous analytical studies
of the beale cyphers and various types of simulations.

a note on reliable full-duplex transmission over half-duplex links

a simple procedure for achieving reliable full-duplex
transmission over half-duplex links is 
proposed. the scheme is compared with another of the
same type, which has recently been described in 
the literature.  finally, some comments are made on
another group of related transmission procedures 
which have been shown to be unreliable under some circumstances.

fen-an axiomatic basis for program semantics

a formal system is presented which abstracts
the notions of data item, function, and relation. 
 it is argued that the system is more suitable than set
theory (or its derivatives) for the concise and 
accurate description of program semantics.  it is shown
how the system can be used to build composite 
data types out of simper ones

functions are shown to be definable in the system. 
 it is described how the local environment can be modeled
as a data item and how imperative statements 
can be considered functions on the environment.  the
nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, 
and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced
into the system.  the technique is contrasted 
with the use of the paradoxical combinator, y.  the
questions of local and global environments and of 
various modes of function calling and parameter passing
are touched upon. the theory is applied to the 
proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics
of the assignment, conditional, and iterative 
statements.  an appendix is included which presents in
detail the formal system governing webs and fen, 
the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper.

cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems

a cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical 
************************
 interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.  the chief computational advantage 
offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed
achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel 
processing.  in this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  for example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  a major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  in particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, pert chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 these 
************************
s of networks. 
 these algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

algorithm is presented which solves the problem in time
which grows linearly with the number of characters

abstraction mechanisms in clu

clu is a new programming language designed to support
the use of abstractions in program construction. 
 work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 clu provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  this paper provides an in troduction
to the abstraction mechanisms in clu.  by 
means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction 
is illustrated, and it is shown how clu programs may
be written to use and implement abstractions.  the 
clu library, which permits incremental program development
with complete type checking performed at compile

s of computer problems.  by the use of tensor calculus
and a computer language designed to facilitate

and differentiation. to illustrate the 
techniques involved, a digital computer has been used
to derive the equations of motion of a point mass 
in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system.
 since this operation involves a formulation in 
terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients,
it provides a good demonstration of a computer's 
capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the
formulation process which normally precedes the

three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  these criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  to define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed

a language extension for expressing constraints on data access

controlled sharing of information is needed and
desirable for many applications and is supported 
in operating systems by access control mechanisms.  this
paper shows how to extend programming languages 
to provide controlled sharing.  the extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 the constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 the approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.
