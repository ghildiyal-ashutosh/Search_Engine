conversion of decision tables by rule mask method without rule mask two algorithms for generating computer programs from decision tables are described the algorithms allow handling limited entry extended entry and mixed entry tables the algorithms are based on the rule mask method but need not have the masks at execution time they perform the logical operations immediately rather than at the end of the interpreting process execution time can be considerably reduced by instantly marking rules which are not applicable algorithms 1 and 2 or conditions which are already tested algorithm 2 the new algorithms combine to a certain degree the advantages of mask methods with those of tree methods cacm october 1972 dathe g decision tables rule mask rule mask method rule mask technique program generator 3 50 4 12 4 19 4 29 ca721005 jb january 27 1978 3 02 pm 1354 4 2273 1354 4 2273 1354 4 2273 1488 4 2273 1488 4 2273 1684 4 2273 1994 4 2273 2053 4 2273 2053 4 2273 2053 4 2273 2053 4 2273 2220 4 2273 2220 4 2273 2220 4 2273 2220 4 2273 2221 4 2273 2273 4 2273 2273 4 2273 2273 4 2273 2273 4 2273 2273 4 2273 2273 4 2273 2453 4 2273 2453 4 2273 2453 4 2273 2453 4 2273 2517 4 2273 2598 4 2273 2598 4 2273 2726 4 2273 2726 4 2273 2726 4 2273 2726 4 2273 2856 4 2273 2856 4 2273 2856 4 2273 2856 4 2273 2856 4 2273 3034 4 2273 3113 4 2273 1172 5 2273 1237 5 2273 1327 5 2273 1354 5 2273 2053 5 2273 2220 5 2273 2273 5 2273 2273 5 2273 2273 5 2273
