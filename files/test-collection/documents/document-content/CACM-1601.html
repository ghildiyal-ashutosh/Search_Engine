parallel numerical methods for the solution of equations classical iterative procedures for the numerical solution of equations provide at each stage a single new approximation to the root in question a technique is given for the development of numerical procedures which provide at each stage several approximations to a solution of an equation the s8everal approximations obtained in any iteration are computationally independent making the methods of interest in a parallel processing environment convergence is insured by extracting the best information at each iteration several families of numerical procedures which use the technique of the procedures in a parallel processing environment are developed and measurements of these statistics are reported these measurements are interpreted in a parallel processing environment in such an environment the procedures obtained are superior to standard algorithms cacm may 1967 shedler g s ca670505 jb february 28 1978 10 44 am 1601 5 1601 1601 5 1601 1601 5 1601 1781 5 1601 123 6 1601 196 6 1601 919 6 1601 990 6 1601 1007 6 1601 1046 6 1601 1131 6 1601 1139 6 1601 1140 6 1601 1149 6 1601 1198 6 1601 1215 6 1601 1223 6 1601 1265 6 1601 1303 6 1601 1323 6 1601 1358 6 1601 1366 6 1601 1421 6 1601 1460 6 1601 1462 6 1601 1463 6 1601 1467 6 1601 1468 6 1601 1477 6 1601 1491 6 1601 1496 6 1601 1531 6 1601 1535 6 1601 1565 6 1601 1601 6 1601 1602 6 1601 1613 6 1601 1614 6 1601 1626 6 1601 1641 6 1601 1787 6 1601 1788 6 1601 205 6 1601 224 6 1601 249 6 1601 288 6 1601 316 6 1601 381 6 1601 398 6 1601 11 6 1601 404 6 1601 410 6 1601 463 6 1601 464 6 1601 483 6 1601 3184 6 1601 3188 6 1601 584 6 1601 600 6 1601 680 6 1601 691 6 1601 763 6 1601 799 6 1601
