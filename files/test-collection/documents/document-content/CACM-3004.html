structured programming in cobol an approach for application programmers techniques for designing and writing cobol programs are presented previous work in structured programming is drawn upon and adapted the presentation is informal the terminology is nonmathematical as far as possible no theorems are proved and examples are used frequently top down program design is implemented through the use of structured flowcharts disciplined specifications and step by step verification a well formed cobol program is defined the proper use of the go to and other cobol coding practices are discussed cacm january 1977 van gelder a structured programming top down well formed program go to statement repeat statement flowchart application programming cobol software reliability program verification 4 0 4 22 5 24 ca770101 jb january 3 1978 12 44 am 2193 4 3004 2326 4 3004 2477 4 3004 2480 4 3004 2541 4 3004 2594 4 3004 2704 4 3004 2709 4 3004 2709 4 3004 2738 4 3004 2738 4 3004 2802 4 3004 2866 4 3004 2867 4 3004 2869 4 3004 2941 4 3004 2958 4 3004 3004 4 3004 3004 4 3004 3004 4 3004 3004 4 3004 3004 4 3004 3030 4 3004 3030 4 3004 3121 4 3004 3155 4 3004 1425 5 3004 2247 5 3004 2356 5 3004 2456 5 3004 3004 5 3004 3004 5 3004 3004 5 3004 3186 5 3004
