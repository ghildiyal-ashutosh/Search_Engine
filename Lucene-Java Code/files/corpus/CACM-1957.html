the list set generator a construct for evaluating set expressions the list set generator is defined and algorithms for its use are given the list set generator is a construct which may be added to a list processing system or any system that handles sets it efficiently generates the set which results from any expression involving sets and set operators the efficiency derives from evaluating the expression as a whole and in parallel rather than evaluating subexpressions and then using those sets to arrive at the final result cacm december 1970 shapiro s c set manipulating list processing set generation sets lists file processing 3 73 3 74 4 22 ca701206 jb february 9 1978 3 23 pm 1024 4 1957 1051 4 1957 1098 4 1957 1214 4 1957 1380 4 1957 1388 4 1957 1393 4 1957 1485 4 1957 1487 4 1957 1549 4 1957 1570 4 1957 1860 4 1957 1878 4 1957 1946 4 1957 1957 4 1957 1957 4 1957 1957 4 1957 2155 4 1957 2151 4 1957 2162 4 1957 2168 4 1957 2723 4 1957 2857 4 1957 3103 4 1957 3112 4 1957 3148 4 1957 1389 5 1957 1860 5 1957 1957 5 1957 1957 5 1957 1957 5 1957 731 5 1957
