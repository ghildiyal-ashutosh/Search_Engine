outer space or just space is the expanse that exists beyond the earth and between celestial bodies outer space is not completely empty it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation magnetic fields neutrinos dust and cosmic rays the baseline temperature as set by the background radiation from the big bang is 2 7 kelvins 270 45 c 454 81 f 1 the plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic ordinary matter in the universe it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins 2 local concentrations of this plasma have condensed into stars and galaxies studies indicate that 90 of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form called dark matter which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces 3 4 observations suggest that the majority of the mass energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label dark energy 5 6 intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the earth s surface however the k rm n line an altitude of 100 km 62 mi above sea level 7 8 is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping the framework for international space law was established by the outer space treaty which entered into force on 10 october 1967 this treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space despite the drafting of un resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space anti satellite weapons have been tested in earth orbit humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high altitude balloon flights followed by manned rocket launches earth orbit was first achieved by yuri gagarin of the soviet union in 1961 and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the solar system due to the high cost of getting into space manned spaceflight has been limited to low earth orbit and the moon outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and radiation microgravity also has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss in addition to these health and environmental issues the economic cost of putting objects including humans into space is very high in 350 bce greek philosopher aristotle suggested that nature abhors a vacuum a principle that became known as the horror vacui this concept built upon a 5th century bce ontological argument by the greek philosopher parmenides who denied the possible existence of a void in space 9 based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist in the west it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty 10 as late as the 17th century the french philosopher ren descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled 11 in ancient china the 2nd century astronomer zhang heng became convinced that space must be infinite extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the sun and the stars the surviving books of the hs an yeh school said that the heavens were boundless empty and void of substance likewise the sun moon and the company of stars float in the empty space moving or standing still 12 the italian scientist galileo galilei knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity in 1640 he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum however it would remain for his pupil evangelista torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643 this experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in europe the french mathematician blaise pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower 13 in 1648 his brother in law florin p rier repeated the experiment on the puy de d me mountain in central france and found that the column was shorter by three inches this decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand then contract upon descent 14 in 1650 german scientist otto von guericke constructed the first vacuum pump a device that would further refute the principle of horror vacui he correctly noted that the atmosphere of the earth surrounds the planet like a shell with the density gradually declining with altitude he concluded that there must be a vacuum between the earth and the moon 15 back in the 15th century german theologian nicolaus cusanus speculated that the universe lacked a center and a circumference he believed that the universe while not infinite could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained 16 these ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the italian philosopher giordano bruno in the 16th century he extended the copernican heliocentric cosmology to the concept of an infinite universe filled with a substance he called aether which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies 17 english philosopher william gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void 18 this concept of an aether originated with ancient greek philosophers including aristotle who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move 19 the concept of a universe filled with a luminiferous aether retained support among some scientists until the early 20th century this form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate 20 in 1887 the michelson morley experiment tried to detect the earth s motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planet s motion however the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept the idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned it was replaced by albert einstein s theory of special relativity which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant independent of the observer s motion or frame of reference 21 22 the first professional astronomer to support the concept of an infinite universe was the englishman thomas digges in 1576 23 but the scale of the universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the german astronomer friedrich bessel he showed that the star 61 cygni had a parallax of just 0 31 arcseconds compared to the modern value of 0 287 this corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years 24 in 1917 heber curtis noted that novae in spiral nebulae were on average 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae suggesting that the former are 100 times further away 25 the distance to the andromeda galaxy was determined in 1923 by american astronomer edwin hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy a new technique discovered by henrietta leavitt 26 this established that the andromeda galaxy and by extension all galaxies lay well outside the milky way 27 the modern concept of outer space is based on the big bang cosmology first proposed in 1931 by the belgian physicist georges lema tre 28 this theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous expansion the earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the swiss physicist charles guillaume in 1896 using the estimated radiation of the background stars he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5 6 k british physicist arthur eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3 18 k in 1926 german physicist erich regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2 8 k in 1933 29 american physicists ralph alpher and robert herman predicted 5 k for the temperature of space in 1948 based on the gradual decrease in background energy following the then new big bang theory 29 the modern measurement of the cosmic microwave background is about 2 7k the term outward space was used in 1842 by the english poet lady emmeline stuart wortley in her poem the maiden of moscow 30 the expression outer space was used as an astronomical term by alexander von humboldt in 1845 31 it was later popularized in the writings of h g wells in 1901 32 the shorter term space is older first used to mean the region beyond earth s sky in john milton s paradise lost in 1667 33 according to the big bang theory the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about 13 8 billion years ago 34 which rapidly expanded about 380 000 years later the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen the so called recombination epoch when this happened matter and energy became decoupled allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space 35 matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars galaxies and other astronomical objects leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space 36 as light has a finite velocity this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe 35 this leaves open the question as to whether the universe is finite or infinite the present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe these observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is flat meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe except for local gravity 37 the flat universe combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating expansion of the universe indicates that space has a non zero vacuum energy which is called dark energy 38 estimates put the average energy density of the present day universe at the equivalent of 5 9 protons per cubic meter including dark energy dark matter and baryonic matter ordinary matter composed of atoms the atoms account for only 4 6 of the total energy density or a density of one proton per four cubic meters 39 the density of the universe however is clearly not uniform it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies including very high density in structures within galaxies such as planets stars and black holes to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density at least in terms of visible matter 40 unlike matter and dark matter dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass energy in the universe dark energy s influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the milky way 41 outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum it has effectively no friction allowing stars planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits following the initial formation stage however even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter 42 by comparison the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter 43 44 the low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023 km or 10 billion light years 45 in spite of this extinction which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy 46 stars planets and moons retain their atmospheres by gravitational attraction atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space 47 the earth s atmospheric pressure drops to about 0 032 pa at 100 kilometres 62 miles of altitude 48 compared to 100 000 pa for the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac definition of standard pressure above this altitude isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind the thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure temperature and composition and varies greatly due to space weather 49 the temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas as it is on earth however the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium 50 51 all of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the big bang which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation cmb there is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background 52 the current black body temperature of the background radiation is about 3 k 270 c 454 f 53 the gas temperatures in outer space are always at least the temperature of the cmb but can be much higher for example the corona of the sun reaches temperatures over 1 2 2 6 million k 54 magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small scale dynamos creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5 10 g the davis greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy s magnetic field resulting in weak optical polarization this has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies magneto hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes non thermal radio sources have been detected even among the most distant high z sources indicating the presence of magnetic fields 55 outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays these particles have energies ranging from about 106 ev up to an extreme 1020 ev of ultra high energy cosmic rays 56 the peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109 ev with approximately 87 protons 12 helium nuclei and 1 heavier nuclei in the high energy range the flux of electrons is only about 1 of that of protons 57 cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers 58 according to astronauts like don pettit space has a burned metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment similar to the scent of an arc welding torch 59 60 despite the harsh environment several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods species of lichen carried on the esa biopan facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007 61 seeds of arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1 5 years 62 a strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low earth orbit or a simulated martian environment 63 the lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world a conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the solar system with potentially microorganism bearing rocks being exchanged between venus earth and mars 64 even at relatively low altitudes in the earth s atmosphere conditions are hostile to the human body the altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the human body is called the armstrong line named after american physician harry g armstrong it is located at an altitude of around 19 14 km 11 89 mi at or above the armstrong line fluids in the throat and lungs boil away more specifically exposed bodily liquids such as saliva tears and liquids in the lungs boil away hence at this altitude human survival requires a pressure suit or a pressurized capsule 65 once in space sudden exposure of unprotected humans to very low pressure such as during a rapid decompression can cause pulmonary barotrauma a rupture of the lungs due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest 66 even if the subject s airway is fully open the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture 67 rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia 66 as a consequence of rapid decompression oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes 68 blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6 3 kpa and this condition is called ebullism 69 the steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels so some blood remains liquid 70 71 swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit the crew altitude protection suit caps a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kpa 72 supplemental oxygen is needed at 8 km 5 0 mi to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss while above 20 km 12 mi pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism 73 most space suits use around 30 39 kpa of pure oxygen about the same as on the earth s surface this pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and gas embolisms if not managed 74 humans evolved for life in earth gravity and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health initially more than 50 of astronauts experience space motion sickness this can cause nausea and vomiting vertigo headaches lethargy and overall malaise the duration of space sickness varies but it typically lasts for 1 3 days after which the body adjusts to the new environment longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton or spaceflight osteopenia these effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise 75 other effects include fluid redistribution slowing of the cardiovascular system decreased production of red blood cells balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system lesser symptoms include loss of body mass nasal congestion sleep disturbance and puffiness of the face 76 for long duration space travel radiation can pose an acute health hazard exposure to high energy ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue nausea vomiting as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count over longer durations symptoms include an increased risk of cancer plus damage to the eyes nervous system lungs and the gastrointestinal tract 77 on a round trip mars mission lasting three years a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut s body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei 78 the energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers however the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures 79 there is no clear boundary between earth s atmosphere and space as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases there are several standard boundary designations namely in 2009 scientists reported detailed measurements with a supra thermal ion imager an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions which allowed them to establish a boundary at 118 km 73 mi above earth the boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the earth s atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space which can reach speeds well over 268 m s 600 mph 83 84 the outer space treaty provides the basic framework for international space law it covers the legal use of outer space by nation states and includes in its definition of outer space the moon and other celestial bodies the treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty it also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space the treaty was passed by the united nations general assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the ussr the united states of america and the united kingdom as of 2017 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty an additional 25 states signed the treaty without ratifying it 85 86 since 1958 outer space has been the subject of multiple united nations resolutions of these more than 50 have been concerning the international co operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space 87 four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the un s committee on the peaceful uses of outer space still there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space and anti satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the us ussr china 88 and in 2019 india 89 the 1979 moon treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies including the orbits around such bodies over to the international community however this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight 90 in 1976 eight equatorial states ecuador colombia brazil congo zaire uganda kenya and indonesia met in bogot colombia with their declaration of the first meeting of equatorial countries or the bogot declaration they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country 91 these claims are not internationally accepted 92 a spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity for a low earth orbit this velocity is about 7 800 m s 28 100 km h 17 400 mph 93 by contrast the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft was 2 200 m s 7 900 km h 4 900 mph in 1967 by the north american x 15 94 to achieve an orbit a spacecraft must travel faster than a sub orbital spaceflight the energy required to reach earth orbital velocity at an altitude of 600 km 370 mi is about 36 mj kg which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude 95 spacecraft with a perigee below about 2 000 km 1 200 mi are subject to drag from the earth s atmosphere 96 which decreases the orbital altitude the rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite s cross sectional area and mass as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere below about 300 km 190 mi decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days once a satellite descends to 180 km 110 mi it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere 97 the escape velocity required to pull free of earth s gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about 11 200 m s 40 300 km h 25 100 mph 98 space is a partial vacuum its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and winds that dominate within them and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond geospace extends from earth s atmosphere to the outer reaches of earth s magnetic field whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space 99 interplanetary space extends to the heliopause whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium 100 interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy where it fades into the intergalactic void 101 geospace is the region of outer space near earth including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere 99 the van allen radiation belts lie within the geospace the outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause which forms an interface between the earth s magnetosphere and the solar wind the inner boundary is the ionosphere 102 the variable space weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the sun and the solar wind the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics the study of the sun and its impact on the planets of the solar system 103 the day side magnetopause is compressed by solar wind pressure the subsolar distance from the center of the earth is typically 10 earth radii on the night side the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than 100 200 earth radii 104 105 for roughly four days of each month the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the moon passes through the magnetotail 106 geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities the motions of which are controlled by the earth s magnetic field these plasmas form a medium from which storm like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the earth s upper atmosphere geomagnetic storms can disturb two regions of geospace the radiation belts and the ionosphere these storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics interfering with shortwave radio communication and gps location and timing 107 magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts even in low earth orbit they also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles 108 although it meets the definition of outer space the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the k rm n line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites 97 this region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft some of this debris re enters earth s atmosphere periodically 109 earth s gravity keeps the moon in orbit at an average distance of 384 403 km 238 857 mi the region outside earth s atmosphere and extending out to just beyond the moon s orbit including the lagrangian points is sometimes referred to as cislunar space 110 the region of space where earth s gravity remains dominant against gravitational perturbations from the sun is called the hill sphere 111 this extends well out into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1 of the mean distance from earth to the sun 112 or 1 5 million km 0 93 million mi deep space has different definitions as to where it starts it has been defined by the united states government and others as any region beyond cislunar space 113 114 115 116 the international telecommunication union responsible for radio communication including satellites defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance 7009200000000000000 2 106 km 117 interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere the heliosphere for billions of kilometers into space this wind has a particle density of 5 10 protons cm3 and is moving at a velocity of 350 400 km s 780 000 890 000 mph 118 interplanetary space extends out to the heliopause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the sun 100 the distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind 119 the heliopause in turn deflects away low energy galactic cosmic rays with this modulation effect peaking during solar maximum 120 the volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the earth however this space is not completely empty and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles there is also gas plasma and dust 121 small meteors and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy 122 a cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light 123 interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the sun 118 there are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as jupiter saturn mercury and the earth that have their own magnetic fields these are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape with the long tail extending outward behind the planet these magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources creating belts of charged particles such as the van allen radiation belts planets without magnetic fields such as mars have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind 124 interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma 101 the contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium approximately 70 of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms most of the remainder consists of helium atoms this is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis these atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula 125 the cataclysmic explosion of a supernova generates an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium 126 the density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably the average is around 106 particles per m3 127 but cold molecular clouds can hold 108 1012 per m3 50 125 a number of molecules exist in interstellar space as can tiny 0 1 m dust particles 128 the tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur including the formation of organic polyatomic species much of this chemistry is driven by collisions energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium resulting for example in the trihydrogen cation an ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions 129 the local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100 parsecs pc of the sun which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the solar system this volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the local bubble which is characterized by a lack of dense cold clouds it forms a cavity in the orion arm of the milky way galaxy with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders such as those in the constellations of ophiuchus and taurus the actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250 pc or more this volume contains about 104 105 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium the local bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7 000 k and radii of 0 5 5 pc 130 when stars are moving at sufficiently high peculiar velocities their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium for decades it was assumed that the sun had a bow shock in 2012 data from interstellar boundary explorer ibex and nasa s voyager probes showed that the sun s bow shock does not exist instead these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium 131 132 a bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause called the heliopause in the solar system 132 intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the universe has a foam like structure with clusters and groups of galaxies lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space the remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies typically a void spans a distance of 10 40 h 1 mpc where h is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s 1 mpc 1 133 surrounding and stretching between galaxies there is a rarefied plasma 134 that is organized in a galactic filamentary structure 135 this material is called the intergalactic medium igm the density of the igm is 5 200 times the average density of the universe 136 it consists mostly of ionized hydrogen i e a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons as gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids it heats up to temperatures of 105 k to 107 k 2 which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei this is why the igm is ionized at these temperatures it is called the warm hot intergalactic medium whim although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards 105 k is often called warm in astrophysics computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the universe might exist in this warm hot rarefied state 136 137 138 when gas falls from the filamentary structures of the whim into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments it can heat up even more reaching temperatures of 108 k and above in the so called intracluster medium 139 for the majority of human history space was explored by observations made from the earth s surface initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope prior to the advent of reliable rocket technology the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through the use of balloon flights in 1935 the u s explorer ii manned balloon flight had reached an altitude of 22 km 14 mi 140 this was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the german a 4 rocket climbed to an altitude of about 80 km 50 mi in 1957 the unmanned satellite sputnik 1 was launched by a russian r 7 rocket achieving earth orbit at an altitude of 215 939 kilometres 134 583 mi 141 this was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961 when yuri gagarin was sent into orbit on vostok 1 the first humans to escape low earth orbit were frank borman jim lovell and william anders in 1968 on board the u s apollo 8 which achieved lunar orbit 142 and reached a maximum distance of 377 349 km 234 474 mi from the earth 143 the first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the soviet luna 1 which performed a fly by of the moon in 1959 144 in 1961 venera 1 became the first planetary probe it revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly by of venus although contact was lost before reaching venus the first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly by of venus by mariner 2 145 the first fly by of mars was by mariner 4 in 1964 since that time unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the solar system s planets as well their moons and many minor planets and comets they remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space as well as observation of the earth 146 in august 2012 voyager 1 became the first man made object to leave the solar system and enter interstellar space 147 the absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum this is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the hubble space telescope allowing light from more than 13 billion years ago almost to the time of the big bang to be observed 148 however not every location in space is ideal for a telescope the interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets moving an infrared telescope out past the dust increases its effectiveness 149 likewise a site like the daedalus crater on the far side of the moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers earth based observations 150 unmanned spacecraft in earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization they allow direct monitoring of weather conditions relay long range communications like television provide a means of precise navigation and allow remote sensing of the earth the latter role serves a wide variety of purposes including tracking soil moisture for agriculture prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs detection of diseases in plants and trees and surveillance of military activities 151 the deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces 152 however like asteroid mining space manufacturing requires significant investment with little prospect of immediate return 153 an important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into earth orbit 7 000 25 000 per kg in inflation adjusted dollars according to a 2006 estimate 154 proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non rocket spacelaunch momentum exchange tethers and space elevators 155 interstellar travel for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility the distances to the nearest stars will require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades for example the daedalus project study which proposed a spacecraft powered by the fusion of deuterium and he3 would require 36 years to reach the nearby alpha centauri system other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include light sails ramjets and beam powered propulsion more advanced propulsion systems could use antimatter as a fuel potentially reaching relativistic velocities 156
