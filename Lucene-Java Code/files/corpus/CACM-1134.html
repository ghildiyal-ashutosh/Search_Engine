some effects of the 6600 computer on language structures the problem of compiling efficient 6600 codes prompted the development of an intermediate language reflecting the structure of the machine that is more easily manipulated in improving object program efficiency the subject of this paper is the intermediate language and methods of manipulating it compilations of a series of arithmetic statements are discussed it is assumed that all functions and exponentials have been removed from these statements and replaced by simple variables for purposes of simplicity the treatment of subscripts is ignored a simplified 6600 structure is presented to illustrate the compiling method several assumptions are made for purposes of simplification although there are cases in which the assumptions are violated in the actual machine cacm february 1964 allard r w wolf k a zemlin r a ca640209 jb march 10 1978 3 54 am 1134 4 1134 1134 4 1134 1134 4 1134 1141 4 1134 1179 4 1134 1861 4 1134 364 4 1134 405 4 1134 438 4 1134 561 4 1134 44 4 1134 83 4 1134 1134 5 1134 1134 5 1134 1134 5 1134 1613 5 1134 1947 5 1134 408 5 1134 17 5 1134 77 5 1134 987 6 1134 1086 6 1134 1134 6 1134 1134 6 1134 1223 6 1134 1248 6 1134 1453 6 1134 399 6 1134 3184 6 1134
