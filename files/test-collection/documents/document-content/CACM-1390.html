convert a programming language is described which is applicable to problems conveniently described by transformation rules by this is meant that patterns may be prescribed each being associated with a skeleton so that a series of such pairs may be searched until a pattern is found which matches an expression to be transformed the conditions for a match are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions to be identified and eventually substituted into the corresponding skeleton the primitive patterns and primitive skeletons are described as well as the principle which allow their elaboration in to more complicated patterns and skeletons the advantages of the language are that it allows one to apply transformation rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings that both patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively and that as a consequence programs may be stated quite concisely cacm august 1966 guzman a mcintosh h v ca660808 jb march 2 1978 7 32 pm 1024 4 1390 1051 4 1390 1102 4 1390 1132 4 1390 1390 4 1390 1486 4 1390 1549 4 1390 1706 4 1390 1826 4 1390 1878 4 1390 378 4 1390 2060 4 1390 2155 4 1390 2168 4 1390 2719 4 1390 2723 4 1390 2838 4 1390 2842 4 1390 2855 4 1390 2879 4 1390 3077 4 1390 3080 4 1390 3106 4 1390 627 4 1390 106 4 1390 210 5 1390 1390 5 1390 1390 5 1390 1390 5 1390
