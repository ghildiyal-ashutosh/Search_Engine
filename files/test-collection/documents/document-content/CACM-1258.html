an extended arithmetic package in many fields for example algebraic number theory arithmetic must be carried out to a degree of precision which exceeds the normal hardware capacity of most machines in such cases an extended arithmetic package provides a comprehensive and easy to use way of performing such arithmetic such a package was coded for the ibm 7090 in discussing the general problems associated with the design of an extended arithmetic package specific reference is made to this program cacm may 1965 blum b i ca650513 jb march 7 1978 1 01 pm 1026 4 1258 1258 4 1258 1258 4 1258 1292 4 1258 1292 4 1258 1497 4 1258 1497 4 1258 1975 4 1258 2605 4 1258 107 5 1258 1026 5 1258 1258 5 1258 1258 5 1258 1258 5 1258
