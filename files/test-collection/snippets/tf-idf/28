storage utilization in a memory hierarchy when storage
assignment is performed by a hashing algorithm

the utilization of storage is studied in a two-level
memory hierarchy.  the first storage level, 
which is the fast store, is divided into a number of
storage areas.  when an entry is to be filed in 
the hierarchy, a hashing algorithm will attempt to
place the entry into one of these areas.  if this 
particular area is full, then the entry will be placed
into the slower second-level store, even though 
other areas in the first-level store may have space
available.  given the n entries have been filed in 
the entire hierarchy, an expression is derived for the
expected number of entries filed in the first-level 
storehis expression gives a measure of how effectively
the first-level store is being used.  by means 
of examples, storage utilization is then studied as a
function of the hashing algorithm, the number of 
storage areas into which the first-level store is divided
and the total size of the first-level store.

this note presents an improvement to lelann's
algorithm for finding the largest (or smallest) of a set of uniquely
numbered processes arranged in a circle, in which no central
controller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori.
this decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective
message extinction in order to achieve an average number of
message passes of order (n log n) rather than o(n2).

a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems

an encryption method is presented with the novel
property that publicly revealing an encryption 
key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key.  this has two important consequences: (1) 
couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit
keys, since a message can be enciphered using 
an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient.
 only he can decipher the message, since 
only he knows the corresponding decryption key.  (2)
a message can be "signed" using a privately held 
decryption key.  anyone can verify this signature using
the corresponding publicly revealed encryption 
key.  signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot
later deny the validity of his signature.  this 
has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic
funds transfer" systems.  a message is 
encrypted by representing it as a number m, raising
m to a publicly specified power e, and then taking 
the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly
specified product, n, of two large secret prime 
numbers p and q.  decryption 
************************
 
numbers p and q.  decryption is similar;only a different,
secret, power d is used, where e * d = 1 (mod(p-1) 
* (q-1)).  the security of the system rests in part on
the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, 
n.

a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  the use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary

************************
 of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  in this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary

aspects of the structure of sets of binary

given an integer n, what is the computational
complexity of finding all the primes less than

lists yields an algorithm of o(n) arithmetic 
complexity.  this upper bound is shown to be equivalent
to the theoretical lower bound for sieve methods 
without preprocessing.  use of preprocessing techniques
involving space-time and additive-multiplicative 
tradeoffs reduces this upper bound to o(n/log logn)
and the bit complexity to o(n logn log log logn). 
 a storage requirement is described using o(n logn/log logn) bits as well.

computing standard deviations: accuracy

four algorithms for the numerical computation
of the standard deviation of (unweighted) sampled data
are analyzed.  two of the algorithms are well-known in the statistical
and computational literature; the other two are new algorithms
specifically intended for automatic computation.  our discussion is 
expository, with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of
"accuracy."  each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditions
under which it will be accurate.  we conclude that all four
algorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems, but two
of the algorithms, one new, one old, are substantially more accurate
on difficult problems than are the other two.
