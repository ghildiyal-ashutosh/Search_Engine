one line random number generators and their use in combinations some one line random number generators i e generators requiring a single fortran instruction are discussed and some short fortran programs which mix several such generators are described the aim is to provide methods for incorporating random number generators directly in fortran programs by means of a few in line instructions the advantages are speed avoiding linkage to and from a subroutine convenience and versatility anyone wishing to experiment with generators either using congruential generators by themselves or mixing several generators to provide a composite with potentially better statistical properties than the library generators currently available may wish to consider some of the simple fortran program discussed here cacm november 1968 marsaglia g bray t a random number generation monte carlo simulation 5 5 ca681105 jb february 21 1978 2 54 pm 1674 4 1674 1691 4 1674 1293 5 1674 1674 5 1674 1674 5 1674 1674 5 1674 1794 5 1674 1870 5 1674 2122 5 1674 1674 6 1674 1674 6 1674 1674 6 1674 1691 6 1674
