a multiprogramming monitor for small machines int a combination hardware software monitor designed to control a wide variety of real time input output devices is described the simple hardware additions provide a uniform device to machine interface for such elements as keyboards graphic input devices and interval timers the software relieves the user program from the details of input output timing buffering and task scheduling and provides parallel processing capability user programs communicate with the monitor through a small set of meta instruction which consists mostly of machine language subroutine calls cacm may 1967 hornbuckle g d ca670503 jb february 28 1978 10 57 am 1458 4 1603 1523 4 1603 1603 4 1603 1698 4 1603 1747 4 1603 1748 4 1603 1854 4 1603 1877 4 1603 1960 4 1603 2377 4 1603 2378 4 1603 2497 4 1603 2558 4 1603 2625 4 1603 2632 4 1603 2840 4 1603 2941 4 1603 3105 4 1603 3144 4 1603 1471 5 1603 1603 5 1603 1603 5 1603 1603 5 1603
