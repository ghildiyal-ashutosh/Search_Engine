regular expression search algorithm a method for locating specific character strings embedded in character text is described and an implementation of this method in the form of a compiler is discussed the compiler accepts a regular expression as source language and produces an ibm 7094 program as object language the object program then accepts the text to be searched as input and produces a signal every time an embedded string in the text matches the given regular expression examples problems and solution are also presented cacm june 1968 thompson k search match regular expression 3 74 4 49 5 32 ca680606 jb february 22 1978 4 18 pm 1739 5 1739 1739 5 1739 1739 5 1739 2545 5 1739 2746 5 1739 1665 6 1739 1739 6 1739 1739 6 1739 1781 6 1739 2139 6 1739 2341 6 1739 2545 6 1739 2786 6 1739
