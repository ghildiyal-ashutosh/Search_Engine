implementing clenshaw curtis quadrature i methodology and experience clenshaw curtis quadrature is a particularly important automatic quadrature scheme for a variety of reasons especially the high accuracy obtained from relatively few integrand values however it has received little use because it requires the computation of a cosine transformation and the arithmetic cost of this has been prohibitive this paper is in two parts a companion paper ii computing the cosine transformation shows that this objection can be overcome by computing the cosine transformation by a modification of the fast fourier transform algorithm this first part discusses the strategy and various error estimates and summarizes experience with a particular implementation of the scheme cacm may 1972 gentleman w m clenshaw curtis numerical integration automatic quadrature error estimates chebyshev series 5 16 ca720505 jb january 31 1978 10 05 am 1982 4 2355 2355 4 2355 2355 4 2355 2355 4 2355 2355 4 2355 2355 4 2355 2355 4 2355 2355 4 2355 2350 4 2355 2350 4 2355 2354 4 2355 2354 4 2355 2354 4 2355 2354 4 2355 1418 5 2355 1521 5 2355 1597 5 2355 1883 5 2355 2040 5 2355 2350 5 2355 2354 5 2355 2355 5 2355 2355 5 2355 2355 5 2355 2640 5 2355 1418 6 2355 1418 6 2355 1521 6 2355 1597 6 2355 1679 6 2355 2350 6 2355 2354 6 2355 2355 6 2355 2355 6 2355 2355 6 2355
