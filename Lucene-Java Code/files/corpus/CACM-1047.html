generation of test matrices by similarity transformations a method for obtaining test matrices with a prescribed distribution of characteristic roots is given the process consists of using particularly simple similarity transformations to generate full matrices from canonical forms the matrices generated also have known characteristic vectors inverses and determinants cacm june 1964 ortega j m ca640620 jb march 9 1978 8 50 pm 1047 4 1047 1047 5 1047 1047 5 1047 1047 5 1047 1707 5 1047 496 5 1047 1047 6 1047 511 6 1047
