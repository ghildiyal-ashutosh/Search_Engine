the equivalence of reducing transition
languages and deterministic languages

the class of reducing transition languages
introduced by eickel, paul, bauer, and samelson 
was shown by morris to be a proper superclass of the
simple precedence languages.  in this paper this 
result is extended, showing that, in fact, the first class
is equivalent to the class of deterministic 
context free languages.

an algorithm for the construction of bounded-context parsers

an algorithm is described which accepts an arbitrary context-free
grammar and constructs 
************************

grammar and constructs a bounded-context parser for
it whenever such a parser exists.  in the first part of the paper
the definition of a context-free grammar and the working of a
bounded-context parser are recalled.  the notion of reduction class for
a context-free grammar is then introduced and its connection with
the structure of a bounded-context parser is indicated.  next,
pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes
of a context-free grammar are defined.  finally, the algorithm is described;
it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible
runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes.
in the second part, the utility of the algorithm is discuss
ed in the light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design.
the algorithm is claimed to be particularly useful in the
simultaneous design of a language and a compiler for it.

can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules

parsed subclass of grammars such as the lr(k) grammars
is considered.  the time complexity of this problem 
is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed

of the test.  in the first case, it is shown that for
every k there exists an o(n(k+2)) algorithm for 
testing the lr(k) property, where n is the size of the
grammar in question.  on the other hand, if both 
k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then
the complexity of the problem depends very strongly 
on the representation chosen for k.  more specifically,
it is shown that this problem is np-complete 
when k is expressed in unary.  when k is expressed in
binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic 
exponential time.  these results carry over to many
other parameterized classes of grammars, such as 
the ll(k), strong ll(k), slr(k), lc(k), and strong lc(k) grammars.

context-sensitive parsing

this paper presents a canonical form for context-sensitive
derivations and a parsing algorithm which finds
each context-sensitive analysis once and only once.  the amount of memory
required by the algorithm is essentially no more than the required to 
store a single complete derivation.  in addition, a modified
version of the basic algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses 
for grammars which contain loops.  the algorithm is
also compared with several previous parsers for context-sensitive
grammars and general rewriting systems, and the difference between
the two types of analyses is discussed.  the algorithm appears to
be complementary to an algorithm by s. kuno in several respects, including 
the space-time trade-off and the degree of context dependence involved.

hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have
a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better
than a noncentral hyperplane.  six algorithms for finding central
hyperplanes are tested on three data sets.  although frequently

three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be

a good worst-case method for storing a static table of n entries,
each an integer between 0 and n - 1.  the method requires 0(n) w
words of storage and allows o(logn n) access time.  although our method
is a little complicated to use in practice, our analysis shows
why a simpler algorithm used for compressing lr parsing tables works so well.

formal parsing systems

automatic syntactic analysis has recently become
important for both natural language data processing 
and syntax-directed compilers.  a formal parsing system
g = (v,u,t,r) consists of two finite disjoint 
vocabularies, v and t, a many-many map, u, from v onto
t, and a recursive set r of strings in t called 
syntactic sentence classes.  every program for automatic
syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing 
system.  a directed production analyzer (i,t,x,p) is a
nondeterministic pushdown-store machine with internal 
vocabulary i, input vocabulary t, and all productions
of p in the form:  (z,a) -> ay1 ... ym where  z, 
yi are elements of the set i and a is an element of the
set t.  every context-free language can be analyzed 
by a directed production analyzer.  the kuno-oettinger
multiple-path syntactic analyzer for english is 
a concrete example of a directed production analyzer
and of a working parsing algorithm.  the connection

the editing  of picture segmentations using local analysis of graphs

a major problem in picture processing is the
elimination of the large number of spurious regions 
that result from an initial segmentation by region growing
techniques.  such regions have been eliminated 
either on the basis of semantic information or on the
basis of size and contrast.  a scheme is presented 
which performs eliminations on the basis of local properties
of the region adjacency graph.  the scheme 
is based on definitions of graph properties which are
satisfied when a spurious region is present; then 
editing is equivalent to fast graph operations.  a number of examples are shown.

language analysis in the humanities

the use of the computer in the language-oriented
humanities for exhaustive listing of detail 
(as in indices and concordances) is widespread and accepted
as desirable.  the implications of the computer 
for a "science" of the humanities-a science entailing
gathering data for the construction and testing 
of models-are neither widely recognized nor accepted.
 this paper argues that the computer's  major role 
as to language analysis in the humanities will be the
establishing of such a sciencehus, for those 
areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision
are necessary (e.g. analyzing literature or teaching 
a student to write a composition) the computer
can be a critically important facilitator.

grammar has been designed and implemented on the

innovations include a full,formal description of 
the syntax of a transformational grammar, a directed random
phrase structure generator, a lexical insertion

a simple problem-oriented programming language in

a program for the syntactic analysis of english sentences

a program is described which produces syntactic
analyses of english sentences with respect 
to a transformational grammar.  the main features of the
analyzer are that it uses only a limited dictionary 
of english words and that it pursues all analysis paths
simultaneously while processing the sentence 
from left to right.  the form of representation used
for the dictionary and the grammar is indicated 
and an outline account is given of the analysis procedure.
 techniques for keeping the size of the analysis 
record within reasonable limits and for avoiding the need
for dynamic application of certain transformational 
rules are described.   a number of examples of output
produced by the program are given.  the output 
includes timing information.

method for the computation of linear precedence 
functions associated with a conflict-free matrix of
precedence relations is given.  this algorithm not 
only detects when the precedence functions do not  exist,
but also provides an indication of why they

 the use of boolean matrices to prove the existence

a conceptual framework for a nonprocedural programming language

a sequential programming language forces the
programmer to prescribe explicitly the order in 
which the operations in his program have to be executed,
even if the order is not relevant to the solution 
of his problem.  the requirement to indicate irrelevant
sequencing can be removed if the language provides 
facilities for specifying a task in a nonprocedural
manner.  in general, a program specified in this 
way will allow concurrent evaluation.  this paper describes
a conceptual framework for a high level programming 
language providing both nonprocedural and sequential
facilities.  within a program, nonprocedural and 
sequential program modules may be nested freely.

the multistore parser for hierarchical syntactic structures

a syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patterns
that are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings.  particular
emphasis is given to the system of "significant addresses" by means
of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures
can be substantially reduced.  the description makes frequent use
of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the
parser in an experimental english sentence analyzer.  by structuring
an area of the computer's central core storage in such a way
that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the
data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information
is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated
altogether.  the matches are traced by means of binary masks
and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the
procedure.  the method could be implemented with any interpretive
grammar, provided it can be expressed by the functional classification
of the items composing the input hierarchical structures.
