mechanization of tedious algebra the newcomb operators of planetary theory a computer program has been written to generate tables of formulas for the newcomb operators of planetary theory the newcomb operators are expressed as polynomials in two variables one of which stands for a simple differential operator and the other for an arbitrary integer the polynomials are generated by a recurrence scheme the program is coded in fortran using simple array manipulation techniques to perform the algebraic operations formulas for over 100 newcomb operators have been produced by the program and typeset photographically on an s 560 photon system cacm january 1965 gerard j m izsak i g barnett m p ca650103 jb march 8 1978 2 59 pm 1334 4 1334 1396 4 1334 1444 4 1334 964 5 1334 1334 5 1334 1334 5 1334 1334 5 1334 1396 5 1334 964 6 1334 1028 6 1334 1029 6 1334 1083 6 1334 1132 6 1334 1214 6 1334 1278 6 1334 1334 6 1334 1365 6 1334 1386 6 1334 1387 6 1334 1388 6 1334 1392 6 1334 1393 6 1334 1394 6 1334 1395 6 1334 1396 6 1334 1397 6 1334 1496 6 1334 284 6 1334 407 6 1334 3199 6 1334 3200 6 1334 3201 6 1334 3202 6 1334 3203 6 1334 3204 6 1334 561 6 1334 730 6 1334
