a model for verification of data security in operating systems program verification applied to kernel architectures forms a promising method for providing uncircumventably secure shared computer systems a precise definition of data security is developed here in terms of a general model for operating systems this model is suitable as a basis for verifying many of those properties of an operating system which are necessary to assure reliable enforcement of security the application of this approach to the ucla secure operating system is also discussed cacm september 1978 popek g farber d operating systems security protection program verification 4 35 5 24 ca780904 dh february 5 1979 2 40 pm 2021 4 3068 2222 4 3068 2227 4 3068 2315 4 3068 2326 4 3068 2470 4 3068 2732 4 3068 2865 4 3068 2896 4 3068 2943 4 3068 3014 4 3068 3068 4 3068 3068 4 3068 3077 4 3068 3143 4 3068 1834 5 3068 2869 5 3068 3068 5 3068 3068 5 3068 3068 5 3068 3105 5 3068 1471 6 3068 2625 6 3068 2632 6 3068 2868 6 3068 2939 6 3068 3068 6 3068
