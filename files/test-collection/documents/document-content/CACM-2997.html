convex hulls of finite sets of poin ts in two and three dimensions the convex hulls of sets of n poin ts in two and three dimensions can be determined with o n log n operations the presented algorithms use the divide and conquer technique and recursively apply a merge procedure for two nonin tersecting convex hulls since any convex hull algorithm requires at least o n log n operations the time complexity of the proposed algorithms is optimal within a multiplicative constant cacm february 1977 preparata f p hong s j computational complexity convex hull optimal algorithms planar set of poin ts spatial set of poin ts 4 49 5 25 5 32 ca770203 jb december 30 1977 2 47 am 2997 4 2997 2737 5 2997 2997 5 2997 2997 5 2997 2997 5 2997 3151 5 2997 2997 6 2997
