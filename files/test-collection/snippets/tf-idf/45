interval arithmetic determinant evaluation
and its use in testing for a chebyshev system

two recent papers, one by hansen and one by
hansen and r. r. smith, have shown how interval 
arithmetic (i.) can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations.  in the present paper 
a method proposed by hasen and r. r. smith is compared
with straightforward use of i. in determinant 
evaluation.  computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
i. for determinant evaluation.  an application using

expanding the editing function in language data processing

mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  applications are described,

experiments in automatic learning for a multipurpose heuristic program

an automatic learning capability has been developed
and implemented for use with the multiple 
(multipurpose program that learns) heuristic tree-searching
program, which is presently being applied 
to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus.
multiple's proving program (pp) uses two evaluation 
functions to guide its search for a proof of whether
or not a particular goal is achievable.  thirteen 
general features of predicate calculus clauses were created
for use in the automatic learning of better 
evaluation functions for pp.  a multiple regression
program was used to produce optimal coefficients 
for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features.
 also, automatic data-handling routines were 
written for passing data between the learning program
and the proving program, and for analyzing and 
summarizing results.  data was generally collected for
learning (regression analysis) from the experience 
of pp.  a number of experiments were performed to test
the effectiveness and generality of the learning 
program. results showed that the learning produced dramatic
improvements in the solutions to problems 
which were in the same domain as those used for collection
learning data.  learning was also shown to 
generalize successfully to domains other than those used
for data collection.  another experiment demonstrated 
that the learning program could simultaneously improve
performance on problems in a specific

 on problems in a specific domain and 
on problems in a variety of domains.  some variations

establishment of the acm repository and principles
of the ir system applied to its operation

the history of the establishment of the acm repository
at the moore school, university of pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly.  two principles are presented as
paramount in the provision of information services: 
(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value 
of service exceeding user costs.  these principles serve
as guides in mechanizing the acm repository. 
 the main features of the information system are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search 
************************
,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  the first contribution
to the acm repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  these
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
the catalog is scheduled to appear in computing reviews.
 the indexing system is described in detail. 
 the main catalog is used to describe the documents,
and inverted lists are provided by the repository 
system for retrieval by concept coordination.

on generation of test problems for linear programming codes

users of linear programming computer codes have
realized the necessity of evaluating the capacity, 
effectiveness, and accuracy of the solutions provided
by such codes.  large scale linear programming 
codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correct
solutions without ever having been "bench-marked" 
by test problems with known solutions.  the reason for
this failure to adequately test the codes is that 
rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily
available.  this paper presents a theoretical 
justification and an illustrative implementation of a method
for generating linear programming test problems 
with known solutions.  the method permits the generation
of test problems that are of arbitrary size 
and have a wide range of numerical characteristics.

indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents.

dynamic document processing

the current role of computers in automatic
document processing is briefly outlined, and some 
reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
and of the mechanization of documentation 
processes has not been fulfilled.  a new dynamic document
environment is then outlined in which clustered
files are searched and information is retrieved following
an interactive user-controlled search process. 
 methods are described for an automatic query modification
based on user needs, and for a continuous 
reorganization of the stored information as a function of
earlier file processing and of normal collection 
growth.  the proposed procedures provide powerful tools
for information retrieval and for the control 
of dynamic library collections in which new items
are continually added and old ones are retired.

an automatic data acquisition and inquiry system using disk files

lockheed missiles and space company has installed
a large-scale automatic data acquisition 
(ada) system which ties together the company's manufacturing
facilities located in van nuys and sunnyvale, 
california.  the system includes over 200 remote input
stations which collect and transmit company operating 
data to a central data processing center.  two rca 301
edp systems are used to record and control the 
flow of data transmitted to the data processing center.
 a large capacity rca 366 data disc file is used 
to store information required to provide up-to-date
information in response to inquiries received from 
remotely located inquiry stations.  in addition to storage
of data on the disk files, the system automatically 
records all incoming and outgoing data on magnetic tape
to be used as input to the company's conventional 
off-line business data processing applications.

general performance analysis of key-to-address
transformation methods using an abstract file 
concept

this paper presents a new approach to the analysis
of performance of the various key-to-address 
transformation methods.  in this approach the keys in
a file are assumed to have been selected from the 
key space according to a certain probabilistic selection
algorithm.  all files with the same number of 
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance with the algorithm, and the 
average performance of the transformation methods on
these files will be used as the potential of these 
methods.  using this analysis, methods with the same overall
performance can be classified and key distributions 
partial to certain transformations can be identified.
 all this can be done analytically.  the approach 
is applied to a group of transformation methods
using files whose keys are selected randomly.

distribution are derived as a function 
of: (1) the prior proportion of omitted terms, and (2) the
coefficient of separation between two distributions

one of the problems often associated with information
retrieval, namely, the maintenance 
************************
, namely, the maintenance and use of large 
dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only
infrequently.  a novel method is presented, which 
maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution.  this is
more suited to implementation on storage devices. 
 this method treats text as a string of characters rather
than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  the members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.
the rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages.

performance monitoring in a time-sharing system

a software measurement facility which is part of
a general purpose time-sharing system is described. 
 the date collection facility (dcf) has been implemented
in the michigan terminal system (mts) for the 
system/360 model 67.  it exists for the purpose of monitoring
operating system and user program behavior 
and performance.  the overall structure of mts is outlined
in order to explain the implementation of 
the dcf.  events in the system are identified and recorded
from within the supervisor, and dumped to 
magnetic tape by an auxiliary program for off-line processing.
 events in user programs which are unrelated 
to system actions are recorded with a supervisor call.
 the time of occurrence of each event is accurately 
recorded, and data items are further identified by job and
type.  the overhead associated with data collection 
and its interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed,
and both are shown to be minimal.  several 
examples are given of information obtained with the
facility and of applications in which it has been 
useful.  some general guidelines are offered for
the construction of future monitoring programs.

a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  the use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  in this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

a note on information organization and storage

since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 a general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  there are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  the use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 the results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

a card format for reference files in information processing

this paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  an 80-column ibm card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  the format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  the reference
material includes basically an index, 
************************
 basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
the identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source of the reference.  the 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment,
machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing.
