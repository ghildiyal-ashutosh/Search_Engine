the aliasing problem in computer-generated shaded images

certain defects, such as jagged edges and
disappearing detail, have long been an annoyance 
in digitally generated shaded images.  although increasing
the resolution or defocusing the display can 
attenuate them, an understanding of these defects leads
to more effective methods.  this paper explains 
the observed defects in terms of the aliasing phenomenon
inherent in sampled signals and discusses prefiltering 
as a recognized cure.  a method for evaluating filters
is presented, the application of prefiltering 
to hidden-surface algorithms is discussed, and an

 is discussed, and an implementation
of a filtering tiler is shown accompanied 
by examples of its effectiveness.

secure communications over insecure channels

according to traditional conceptions of cryptographic
security, it is necessary to transmit 
a key, by secret means, before encrypted messages can
be sent securely.  this paper shows that it is 
possible to select a key over open communications channels
in such a fashion that communications security 
can be maintained.  a method is described which forces
any enemy to expend an amount of work which increases 
as the square of the work required of the two communicants
to select the key.  the method provides a 
logically new kind of protection against the passive
eaves dropper.  it suggests that further research 
on this topic will be highly rewarding, both
in a theoretical and a practical sense.

texture and reflection in computer generated images

in 1974 catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. 
 this paper 
************************
 patches. 
 this paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
 the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  the intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. the shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  the patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 the amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  several examples of images synthesized 
using these new techniques are included.

an application of formac

a nonlinear circuit analysis problem is stated
and the way in which it was solved using formac 
is indicated.  the solution of the problem using formac
was notable since several other methods that 
were tried failed.  the problem is straightforward (although
untenable by hand) but nevertheless involved 
an elaborate use of the formac language.  the program
was fairly large and utilized practically every 
command.  in particular, it made extensive use of the
part command.  several tricks were necessary in 
order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the
formac system.  this paper is more concerned with 
the use of programming techniques in formac than with

an interactive software system for computers-aided
design:  an application to circuit project

the characteristics of an interactive software system, intended to constitute 
an interface between designer and computer during various steps of
the design process, are presented.  the main emphasis is given to the
description of the features of the two high level user oriented
languages, operating at different levels, on which the interaction
is based.  the first one is imol, an interactive monitor language,
which is designed to perform the overall and control functions
of the software system; its design criteria provide the user with
commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all
the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design.  the second one is 
coif, a circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed
to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications; 
it is an  extension of fortran with graphic-type variables,
so that the designer who is familiar with fortran need not learn a new 
language.  the application to computer-aided circuit design
is in particular examined; on the other hand, the adopted design
criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages 
to different computer-assisted applications.

hierarchical geometric models for visible surface algorithms

the geometric structure 
************************


the geometric structure inherent in the definition
of the shapes of three-dimensional objects 
and environments is used not just to define their relative
motion and placement, but also to assist in 
solving many other problems of systems for producing
pictures by computer.  by using an extension of 
traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy,
five significant improvements to current 
techniques are possible.  first, the range of complexity
of an environment is greatly increased while 
the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within
a fixed upper limit.  second, a meaningful way 
is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in
a scene.  third, "clipping" becomes a very fast 
logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment
within the field of view.  fourth, frame 
to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical
"working set," or fraction of the total structure 
that should be present in primary store for immediate
access by the visible surface algorithm.  finally, 
the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent,
visible surface algorithm in which the computation 
time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.

reentrant polygon clipping

a new family of clipping algorithms is described.
 these algorithms are able to clip polygons 
against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three
dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which 
lie outside the volume.  in two dimensions the algorithms
permit clipping against irregular convex windows. 
 polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered
sequence of vertices without repetition of first 
and last, in marked contrast to representation as a
collection of edges as was heretofore the common 
procedure.  output polygons have an identical format,
with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe 
any newly-cut edge or edges.  the algorithms easily handle
the particularly difficult problem of detecting 
that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the
clipping window.  the algorithms described achieve 
considerable simplicity by clipping separately against
each clipping plane or window boundary.  code 
capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary
is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries. 
 each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only
two vertex values and may begin its processing 
as soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding
stage is ready.  because the same code is reentered 
for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping
against very complex window shapes is practical. 
 for perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane
truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping 
volume.  the two additional planes parallel to the projection
screen serve to limit the range of depth 
preserved through the projection.  a perspective projection
method which provides for arbitrary view 
angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping
planes is described.  this method is ideal 
for subsequent hidden-surface computations.

a computer generated aid for cluster analysis

a computer generated graphic method, which

scheme of cluster analysis, is described and illustrated.
 the graphic principle used is the representation 
of the elements of a data matrix of similarities or dissimilarities
by computer printed symbols (of character 
overstrikes) of various shades of darkness, where a
dark symbol corresponds to a small dissimilarity. 
 the plots, applied to a data matrix before clustering
and to the rearranged matrix after clustering, 
show at a glance whether clustering brought forth any
distinctive clusters.  a well-known set of data 
consisting of the correlations of 24 psychological tests
is used to illustrate the comparison of groupings 
by four methods of factor analysis and two methods of cluster analysis.

lg: a language for analytic geometry

a conversational programming language for analytic
geometry is described, together with some 
aspects of its implementation.  the language allows
the flexible definition of geometric objects and 
elements, computes their parameters, and displays the results.
it also provides the capability of specifying 
a geometric figure via a collection of parameters and
displaying various loci corresponding to these 
parameters. a third characteristic consists of the possibility
of using this language to design other 
user oriented languages.  lg has been specifically designed
for use by nonprogrammers; it is easy to 
learn and very close to the natural language used in geometry.

blocks-a new data type for snobol4

a new data type, called a block, has been implemented
for snobol4.  a block is a three-dimensional 
aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped,
best thought of as a three-dimensional 
extension to a string.  (the third dimension is used for
overstriking.)  blocks may be printed, concatenated 
in any of three dimensions, and merged on the basis
of program-defined connection points.  some blocks 
adapt in size and shape to their environment.  blocks
and their operations are mainly used for composing 
printable output.  a variety of graphical problems (including
flowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams, 
mathematical-equation formation, and text justification
and preparation) have been programmed on a printer 
in what appears to be an easy and natural way.  in addition
to these somewhat specialized applications, 
blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independent
output formation mechanism especially suitable 
for nonnumerical work.  the concept of a block is largely
language independenthat is, blocks require 
little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily
be absorbed into the external structure of 
most programming languages.

a scan conversion algorithm with reduced storage requirements

most graphics systems using a raster scan output
device (crt or hardcopy) maintain a display 
file in the xy or random scan format.  scan converters,
hardware or software, must be provided to translate 
the picture description from the xy format to the raster
format.  published scan conversion algorithms 
which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enough
to accommodate the entire screen.  on the other 
hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because
they require multiple passes through the xy 
display file.  the scan conversion algorithm described
here uses a linked list data structure to process 
the lines of the drawing in strips 
************************
s of the drawing in strips corresponding to
groups of scan lines.  a relatively small primary 
memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image
for a group of scan lines.  when this portion 
of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for
the next portion.  because of the list processing 
procedures used, only a single pass through the xy display
file is required when generating the binary 
image and only a slight increase in execution time over
the fully buffered core results.  results slow 
that storage requirements can be reduced by more than
80 percent while causing less than a 10 percent 
increase in execution time.

brad: the brookhaven raster display

a multiconsole computer display system has
been designed that provides very rich displays at 
low unit cost.  each brad (brookhaven raster display)
console can plot tens of thousands of points, or 
up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second.  after
an initial display system investment of $50,000 
each display, with teletype, costs less than $3,000.
 the technique employed is that of programmatically 
generating a binary image of the desired display in a
computer.  the image is written on a rotating drum 
memory.  independent read heads continuously display
the picture, which is generated by swept horizontal 
lines.  a standard tv monitor serves as the display device.
 the technique has two drawbacks.  a computer 
must compute any image to be displayed.  also, the "pointing"
interaction is more difficult.  this is 
because the pointing function gives only the coordinates
of the point on the screen.  the inverse of 
the map generation process is required to calculate
the coordinates of the point on the screen.  the 
inverse of the map generation process is required to
calculate the coordinates at the selected point 
in the input space.

conversational access to a 2048-word machine

lap6 is an on-line system running on a 2048-word linc which provides full 
facilities for text editing, automatic filing and file maintenance, and 
program preparation and assembly.  it focuses on the preparation and editing 
of continuously displayed 23,040-character text strings (manuscripts) which
can be positioned anywhere by the user and edited by simply adding
and deleting lines as though working directly on an elastic scroll.
other features are available through a uniform command set which itself can 
be augmented by the user.  the machine, although small,
aids program design by providing display scope and premarked
randomly addressable linc tapes as standard items, in an environment
similar to that of a sophisticated terminal.  the tapes are logically 
similar to a disk.  priority was given to the design of efficient
tape algorithms to minimize the limitations of the small memory.  techniques 
developed for handling scroll editing, filing, and the layered system 
structure are outlined.  lap6 is used by about 2000 people in 11 countries.  
its design was strongly influenced by performance criteria established in 
interviews held with linc users themselves during the specification period.

an approach to the optimum design of computer graphics systems

display system 
************************
 systems

display system designers are faced with the
difficult task of selecting major subsystems in 
an intelligent way.  each subsystem is chosen from large
numbers of alternatives; the selection is based 
on considerations such as system response time, system
cost, and the distribution of data storage and 
processing between the graphics processor and its supporting
data processing system.  the work reported 
here develops an objective, quantitative design procedure
and helps give a better understanding of now 
to  configure display systems.  this is accomplished by
means of a mathematical model of a computer driven 
graphics system.  the parameters of the model are functions
of the capabilities of the graphics hardware 
and of the computational requirements of the graphics application.
 the model can be analyzed using numerical 
queueing analysis or simulation to obtain an average
response time prediction.  by combining the model 
with an optimization, the best graphics system configuration,
subject to a cost constraint, is found 
for several applications.  the optimum configurations
are in turn used to find general display system 
design guidelines.

a parametric algorithm for drawing pictures

an algorithm for drawing pictures of three-dimensional
objects, with surfaces made up of patches 
of quadric surfaces, is described.  the emphasis of
this algorithm is on calculating the intersections 
of quadric surfaces. a parameterization scheme is used.
 each quadric surface intersection curve (qsic) 
is represented as a set of coefficients and parameter
limits.  each value of the parameter represents 
at most two points, and these may easily be distinguished.
 this scheme can find the coordinates of points 
of even quartic (fourth-order) intersection curves, using
equations of no more than second order.  methods 
of parameterization for each type of osic are discussed,
as well as surface bounding and hidden surface 
removal.

a general solution to the problem of constructing 
a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours. 
this surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, 
is constructed by separately determining an optimal
surface between each pair of consecutive contours.
 determining such a surface is reduced to the problem
of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed 
toroidal graph.  a new fast algorithm for finding such
cycles is utilized.  also developed is a closed-form 
expression, in term of the number of contour poin ts, for
an upper bound on the number of operations required 
to execute the algorithm.  an illustrated example which
involves the construction of a minimum area surface 
describing a human head is included.

the synthesis of solids bounded by many faces

a technique is presented which allows a class
of solid objects to be synthesized and stored 
using a computer.  synthesis begins with primitive solids
like a cube, wedge, or cylinder.  any solid 
can be moved, scaled, or rotated.  solids may also be
added together or subtracted.  two algorithms to 
perform addition are described.  for practical designers,
the technique has the advantage that operations 
are concise, readily composed, and are given in terms
of easily imagined solidsuite short sequences 
of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces.

and graphic terminals, we have available a new dimension
in numerical problem solving capabilities.  rather than simply use
the new power to achieve fast turnaround, we can develop interactive
routines which are easy to use and also take advantage of the
insight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver.  several
on-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving
have already been implemented as well as some special purpose
systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary
differential equations.  the advantage of restricting the problem
area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified.
in this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such
systems and design considerations for interactive routines.  furthermore,
an implementation of an on-line least squares data-fitting
program, peg, is presented with results obtained from empirical
data.  in conclusion, area for future work in this field are discussed.

a system for typesetting mathematics

this paper describes the design and implementation
of a system for typesetting mathematics. 
 the language has been designed to be easy to learn
and to use by people (for example, secretaries and 
mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor
typesetting.  experience indicates that the language 
can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules
and fewer exceptions.  for typical expressions, 
the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and
the like necessary to print according to mathematical 
conventions are all done automatically.  for example,
the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 
2 produces (formula).  the syntax of the language is specified
by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler 
is used to make a compiler that translates this language
into typesetting commands.  output maybe produced 
on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward
and reverse half-line motions.  the system 
interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so
mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled 
simply.  this paper was typeset by the authors using the system described

 as it was found that successive improvements to

each trip around.  the degree of physical separation

interference detection among solids and surfaces

in many industrial environments it is necessary to determine whether

interference problems in products made up of assemblies of components 
and in product manufacturing and testing.  typically, drawings
are used in an attempt to detect such unwanted interferences,
but the two-dimensional, static drafting medium does not always show
interferences among three-dimensional, moving parts.  this paper
 presents a computer representation for solids and surfaces and algorithms
which carry out interference

time-sharing and batch-processing:  an experimental

two such systems for what may well be the predominant user
population within the next decade-the professionals 
who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as an
aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather 
than as a programming end in itself.  statistically
and logically significant results indicate equal 
cost for usage of the two computer systems; however,
a much higher level of performance is attained by 
time-sharing users.  there are indications that significantly
lower costs would have resulted if the 
time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached
a performance level equal to that of the batch 
users.  the users' speed of problem-solving and their
attitudes made time-sharing the more favorable

the cyclic order property of vertices as an aid in scene analysis

a cyclic-order property is defined for bodies bounded by smooth-curved faces.
the property is shown to be useful for analyzing pictures of such bodies,
particularly when the line data extracted from the pictures are imperfect.
this property augments previously known grammatical rules that
determine the existence of three-dimensional bodies corresponding
to given two-dimensional line-structure data.

git-a heuristic program for testing pairs
of directed line graphs for isomorphism*

given a pair of directed line graphs, the problem
of ascertaining whether or not they are isomorphic 
is one for which no efficient algorithmic solution is known.
 since a straightforward enumerative algorithm 
might require 40 years of running time on a very high
speed computer in order to compare two 15-node 
graphs, a more sophisticated approach seems called
for.  the situation is similar to that prevailing 
in areas such as game-playing and theorem-proving, where
practical algorithms are unknown (for the

scanned-display computer graphics

a television-like scanned-display 
************************


a television-like scanned-display system has
been successfully implemented on a honeywell ddp-224 
computer installation.  the scanned image is stored
in the core memory of the computer, and software 
scan conversion is used to convert the rectangular coordinates
of a point to the appropriate word and 
bit in an output display array in core storage.  results
thus far indicate that flicker-free displays 
of large amounts of data are possible with reasonably
fast graphical interaction.  a scanned image of 
size 240 x 254 points is displayed at a 30 frame-per-second rate.

person-matching by electronic methods

record linkage in the updating of files is
accomplished in many establishments through the 
use of a preassigned number, such as payroll number,
customer number, or social security number.  in 
vital and health records, however, a unique number
is generally not preassigned to an individual for 
purposes of reporting services received to the health
department.  in order to determine whether different 
physician reports refer to the same individual, name
and other identification must be compared.  this 
is a laborious operation which is subject to various
errors because of name misspellings, changes of 
name upon marriage, and other problems.  we are interested
in the maintenance of a psychiatric case register 
in maryland, where many of the reports from over a hundred
psychiatric agencies refer to the same patient. 
 these records must be linked in order to provide unduplicated
counts of individuals under care and longitudinal 
records of psychiatric history.  an earlier paper [1] describes
our general procedures for register maintenance 
by use of a digital computer (honeywell 800).  here

machine controls for analysis of variance

a major problem in using the analysis of variance,
as the number of factors increases, is the 
exponential rise in the number of interactions.  even
though the experimenter may not be interested in 
these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in
most experimental designs because of the problem 
of getting error terms.  it is natural therefore to look

requirements, improved results over conventional 
engineering design processes are possible.  an english-like

analysis of the availability of computer
systems using computer- aided algebra

analytical results, related to the availability
of a computer system constructed of unreliable 
processors, are presented in this paper.  these results
are obtained by using various computer-aided 
algebraic manipulation techniques.  a major purpose of
this paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties 
of obtaining analytical solutions to markov processes
can be considerably reduced by the application 
of symbol manipulation programs.  since many physical
systems can be modeled by markov and semi-markov 
processes, the potential range of application of these techniques
is much wider than the problem of availability 
analyzed here.

character generators have previously been limited 
to alphanumeric characters.  a display has been described
which extends the capabilities of this organization 
to include general graphics.  two fundamentally different
scan conversion algorithms which have been 
developed to support this display are presented.  one
is most suitable to non-interactive applications 
and the other to interactive applications.  the algorithms
were implemented in fortran on the cdc 6400 
computer.  results obtained from

that the noninteractive algorithms can significantly 
reduce display file storage requirements at little cost
in execution time over that of a conventional 
raster display.  the interactive algorithm can improve
response time and reduce storage requirements.
