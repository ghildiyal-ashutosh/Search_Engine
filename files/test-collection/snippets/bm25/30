texture and reflection in computer generated images

in 1974 catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. 
 this paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
 the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  the intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. the shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  the patch rendering

algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 the amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  several examples of images synthesized

expanding the editing function in language data processing

in automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  applications are described,

some new methods of detecting step edges in digital pictures

this note describes two operators that respond
to step edges, but not to ramps.  the first 
is similar to the digital laplacian, but uses the max, rather
than the sum, of the x and y second differences. 
 the second uses the difference between the mean and
median gray levels in a neighborhood.  the outputs 
obtained from these operators applied to a set of test
pictures are compared with each other and with 
the standard digital laplacian and gradient.  a third
operator, which uses the distance between the center 
and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value, is also
briefly considered; it turns out to be equivalent 
to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient.

growing applications of linear programming

use of linear programming models has grown so
extensively in recent years that the whole concept 
for organizing a computer code has undergone a radical
change.  it no longer is adequate merely to reduce 
a mathematical algorithm (i.e. the simplex method) to
a computer code.  an advanced code must cope with 
such a variety of situations that the respective computer
subprograms must be organized into an integrated 
system.  emphasis in this paper is devoted to the underlying
principles upon which future linear programming 
systems must be based.  these viewpoints are influenced
by the new demands that applications within the 
petroleum industry are placing on such systems.  some
of the components of such a system are: translation 
of problem statement in terms of basic data to linear
programming matrix coefficients, data transmission 
for direct computer entry, data file at the computer center,

a cell organized raster display for line drawings

raster scan computer graphics displays with
"real time" character generators have previously 
been limited to alphanumeric characters.  a display is
described which extends the capabilities of this 
organization to include general graphics.  the feasibility
of such a display is shown by deriving the 
minimum number of patterns required in the read only
memory of the character generator to synthesize 
an arbitrary line.  the synthesis process does not compromise
picture quality since the resulting dot 
patterns are identical with those of a conventional
raster display.  furthermore, the time constraints 
of a raster display are shown to be satisfied for
a typical design for very complex line drawings.

automatic parsing for content analysis

although automatic syntactic and semantic analysis is not yet possible for
all of an unrestricted natural language text, some applications, of which 
content analysis is one, do not have such a stringent coverage requirement.
preliminary studies show that the harvard syntactic analyzer can
produce correct and unambiguous identification of the subject and
object of certain verbs for approximately half of the relevant occurrences. 
this provides a degree of coverage for content analysis variables which 
compares favorably to manual methods, in variables which compares favorably 
to manual methods, in which only a sample of the total available text is

a scan conversion algorithm with reduced storage requirements

most graphics systems using a raster scan output
device (crt or hardcopy) maintain a display 
file in the xy or random scan format.  scan converters,
hardware or software, must be provided to translate 
the picture description from the xy format to the raster
format.  published scan conversion algorithms 
which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enough
to accommodate the entire screen.  on the other 
hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because
they require multiple passes through the xy 
display file.  the scan conversion algorithm described
here uses a linked list data structure to process 
the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to
groups of scan lines.  a relatively small primary 
memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image
for a group of scan lines.  when this portion 
of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for
the next portion.  because of the list processing 
procedures used, only

brad: the brookhaven raster display

a multiconsole computer display system has
been designed that provides very rich displays at 
low unit cost.  each brad (brookhaven raster display)
console can plot tens of thousands of points, or 
up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second.  after
an initial display system investment of $50,000 
each display, with teletype, costs less than $3,000.
 the technique employed is that of programmatically 
generating a binary image of the desired display in a
computer.  the image is written on a rotating drum 
memory.  independent read heads continuously display
the picture, which is generated by swept horizontal 
lines.  a standard tv monitor serves as the display device.
 the technique has two drawbacks.  a computer 
must compute any image to be displayed.  also, the "pointing"
interaction is more difficult.  this is 
because the pointing function gives only the coordinates
of the point on the screen.  the inverse of 
the map generation process is required to calculate
the coordinates of the point on the screen.  the 
inverse of the map generation process is required to
calculate the coordinates at the selected point 
in the input space.

be perfectly reconstructed in time m x n and that 
a pattern similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructed
in time m x n, where m, n are the dimensions

an approach to the optimum design of computer graphics systems

display system designers are faced with the
difficult task of selecting major subsystems in 
an intelligent way.  each subsystem is chosen from large
numbers of alternatives; the selection is based 
on considerations such as system response time, system
cost, and the distribution of data storage and 
processing between the graphics processor and its supporting
data processing system.  the work reported 
here develops an objective, quantitative design procedure
and helps give a better understanding of now 
to  configure display systems.  this is accomplished by
means of a mathematical model of a computer driven 
graphics system.  the parameters of the model are functions
of the capabilities of the graphics hardware 
and of the computational requirements of the graphics application.
 the model can be analyzed using numerical 
queueing analysis or simulation to obtain an average
response time prediction.  by combining the model 
with an optimization, the best graphics system configuration,
subject to a cost constraint, is found 
for several applications.  the optimum configurations

a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems

an encryption method is presented with the novel
property that publicly revealing an encryption 
key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key.  this has two important consequences: (1) 
couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit
keys, since a message can be enciphered using 
an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient.
 only he can decipher the message, since 
only he knows the corresponding decryption key.  (2)
a message can be "signed" using a privately held 
decryption key.  anyone can verify this signature using
the corresponding publicly revealed encryption 
key.  signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot
later deny the validity of his signature.  this 
has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic
funds transfer" systems.  a message is 
encrypted by representing it as a number m, raising
m to a publicly specified power e, and then taking

as a function of surface gradient.

pictorial pattern recognition and the

the availability of interactive, three-dimensional,
computer graphics systems coupled to powerful 
digital computers encourages the development of algorithms
adapted to this environment.  pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to x-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 however, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  a simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the

relaxation methods for image reconstruction

the problem of recovering an image (a function
of two variables) from experimentally available 
integrals of its grayness over thin strips is of great
importance in a large number of scientific areas. 
 an important version of the problem in medicine is
that of obtaining the exact density distribution 
within the human body from x-ray projectionsne approach
that has been taken to solve this problem 
consists of translating the available information into
a system of linear inequalities.  the size and 
the sparsity of the resulting system (typically, 25,000
inequalities with fewer than 1 percent of the 
coefficients nonzero) makes methods using successive
relaxations computationally attractive, as compared 
to other ways of solving systems of inequalities. 
in this paper, it is shown that, for a consistent 
system of linear inequalities, any sequence of relaxarion parameters
lying strictly between 0 and 2 generates 
a sequence of vectors which converges to a solution.
 under the same assumptions, for a system of linear 
equations, the relaxation method converges to the minimum
norm solution.  previously proposed techniques
are shown to be special cases of our procedure with
different choices of relaxation parameters.  the 
practical consequences for image reconstruction of the
choice of the relaxation parameters are discussed.

multiprogram scheduling parts 1 and 2.  introduction and theory*

in order to exploit fully a fast computer which
possesses simultaneous processing abilities, 
it should to a large extent schedule its own workload.
 the scheduling routine must be capable of extremely 
rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating.
 the construction of a schedule entails determining 
which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially
with respect to each other.  a concise 
scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize
the time for executing the entire pending workload 
(or any subset of it), subject to external constraints

a simple algorithm for computing the generalized inverse of a matrix

the generalized inverse of a matrix is important
in analysis because it provides an extension 
of the concept of an inverse which applies to all matrices.
 it also has many applications in numerical 
analysis, but it is not widely used because the existing
algorithms are fairly complicated and require 
considerable storage space.  a simple extension has
been found to the conventional orthogonalization 
method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives

 matrices, which gives
the generalized inverse with little extra effort 
and with no additional storage requirements.  the algorithm
gives the generalized inverse for any m by 
n matrix a, including the special case when m+n and a
is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(a) 
= n.  in the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary
inverse of a.  in the second case the algorithm 
yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix
inv(a'a)a' and has the advantage of avoiding 
the loss of significance which results in forming the product a'a explicitly.

on simulating networks of parallel processes
in which simultaneous events may occur

some of the problems of simulating discrete
event systems, particularly computer systems, on 
a conventional digital computer are dealt with.  the
systems are assumed to be described as a network 
of interconnected sequential processes.  briefly reviewed
are the common techniques used to handle such 
simulations when simultaneous events do not occur, can
be ignored, or can be handled by simple priority 
rules.  following this, the problem of dealing with simultaneous
events in separate processes is introduced. 
 an abstraction of this problem is developed which admits
solution for a majority of commonly encountered
problems.  the technique will either find a method of
simulating the parallel events or report that none 
can be found.  in some of the latter cases it is shown
to be possible to find a solution by extending 
the information available to the solution technique, but
in many cases the technique becomes computationally 
unfeasible when the additional information is provided.

densities in a river using previously developed

including those corresponding to certain types of chemical
and thermal pollution.  as an investigation 
of the accuracy of the simulation methods, a simulation
of the actual population dynamics of asterionella

of conditions in that river. although not totally 
accurate, the simulation was found to predict the general

 in addition, the study demonstrates the usefulness of

system is separated into four programming tasks: picture transformations, file 
maintenance, picture structuring, and display management.  picture structuring
is considered as the vehicle for man-machine communication.
a prototype data format for pictures, called a picture-form, is developed.
structure operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce 
new pictures-forms.  many of the ideas are taken from the symbolic mathematical 
laboratory at mit conceived by marvin minsky.

reconstruction of pictures from their projections

there are situations in the natural sciences
and medicine (e.g. in electron microscopy and 
x-ray photography) in which it is desirable to estimate the
gray levels of a digital picture at the individual 
points from the sums of the gray levels along straight
lines (projections) at a few angles.  usually, 
in such situations, the picture is far from determined
and the problem is to find the "most representative" 
picture.  three algorithms are described (all using
monte carlo methods) which were designed to solve 
this problem.  the algorithms are applicable in a large
and varied number of fields.  the most important 
uses may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particles
from electron micrographs and three-dimensional 
x-ray analysis.

pattern width at a given angle

that the pattern feature "width as a function
of angle" possesses several possible interpretations 
is demonstrated in this paper, which is a review of
the width concept in pattern recognition and the 
geometrical concept itself.  the object of the work
is to clarify how the word description can be made 
precise so that computer algorithms for feature extraction
may be obtained; the focus is on the theoretical 
subject matter.  the results consist of a set-theoretic
definition of width-at-angle, a theorem relating 
it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions
of alternate widths.  all widths are calculated 
for an illustrative example; graphical and tabular comparisons
are given.  substantial variation in width-at-angle 
magnitude is found.  the principal conclusion is that
the set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern 
feature when it can be easily computed.  further investigation
of the information contained in only part 
of a width function is recommended for cases where
computation of width-at-angle is difficult.
