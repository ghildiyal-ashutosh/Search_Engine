programming analysis of variance by sequences of operators and isomorphic mappings a special operator calculus developed by hartley in 1956 together with a new mapping scheme has been found to be efficient in programming analysis of variance for multifactor experiments the operator calculus and the mapping scheme are described in detail cacm july 1964 peng k c ca640702 jb march 9 1978 8 30 pm 1045 5 1045 1045 5 1045 1045 5 1045 1404 5 1045 1045 6 1045
