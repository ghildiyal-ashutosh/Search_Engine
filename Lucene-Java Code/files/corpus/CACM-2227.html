proof of a program find a proof is given of the correctness of the algorithm find first a informal description is given of the purpose of the program and the method used a systematic technique is described for constructing the program proof during the process of coding it in such a way as to prevent the intrusion of logical errors the proof of termination is treated as a separate exercise finally some conclusions relating to general programming methodology are drawn cacm january 1971 hoare c a r proofs of programs programming methodology program documentation program correctness theory of programming 4 0 4 22 5 21 5 23 5 24 ca710107 jb february 8 1978 10 40 am 2021 4 2227 2222 4 2227 2227 4 2227 2227 4 2227 2315 4 2227 2326 4 2227 2470 4 2227 2732 4 2227 2783 4 2227 2865 4 2227 2896 4 2227 2943 4 2227 3014 4 2227 3054 4 2227 3068 4 2227 3077 4 2227 3143 4 2227 1834 5 2227 307 5 2227 2227 5 2227 2227 5 2227 2227 5 2227 2356 5 2227 2420 5 2227 2874 5 2227 3143 5 2227 970 6 2227 1491 6 2227 1682 6 2227 1834 6 2227 2227 6 2227 2227 6 2227 2227 6 2227 2227 6 2227 2317 6 2227 2683 6 2227 2871 6 2227 521 6 2227
