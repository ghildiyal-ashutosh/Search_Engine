the aliasing problem in computer-generated shaded images

certain defects, such as jagged edges and
disappearing detail, have long been an annoyance 
in digitally generated shaded images.  although increasing
the resolution or defocusing the display can 
attenuate them, an understanding of these defects leads
to more effective methods.  this paper explains 
the observed defects in terms of the aliasing phenomenon
inherent in sampled signals and discusses prefiltering 
as a recognized cure.  a method for evaluating filters
is presented, the application of prefiltering 
to hidden-surface algorithms is discussed, and an 
************************

of a filtering tiler is shown accompanied 
by examples of its effectiveness.

texture and reflection in computer generated images

in 1974 catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches.

************************
 patches. 
 this paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
 the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  the intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. the shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  the patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 the amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  several examples of images synthesized 
using these new techniques are included.

an optimal real-time algorithm for planar convex hulls

an algorithm is described for the construction in real-time of the

structure, the algorithm constructs the convex hull by successive
updates, each taking time o(log n), thereby achieving a total

an interactive software system for computers-aided
design:  an application to circuit project

the characteristics of an interactive software system, intended to constitute 
an interface between designer and computer during various steps of
the design process, are presented.  the main emphasis is given to the
description of the features of the two high level user oriented
languages, operating at different levels, on which the interaction
is based.  the first one is imol, an interactive monitor language,
which is designed to perform the overall and control functions
of the software system; its design criteria provide the user with
commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all
the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design.  the second one is 
coif, a circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed
to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications; 
it is an  extension of fortran with graphic-type variables,
so that the designer who is familiar with fortran need not learn a new 
language.  the application to computer-aided circuit design
is in particular examined; on the other hand, the adopted design
criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages 
to different computer-assisted applications.

hierarchical geometric models for visible surface algorithms

the geometric structure 
************************


the geometric structure inherent in the definition
of the shapes of three-dimensional objects 
and environments is used not just to define their relative
motion and placement, but also to assist in 
solving many other problems of systems for producing
pictures by computer.  by using an extension of 
traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy,
five significant improvements to current 
techniques are possible.  first, the range of complexity
of an environment is greatly increased while 
the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within
a fixed upper limit.  second, a meaningful way 
is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in
a scene.  third, "clipping" becomes a very fast 
logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment
within the field of view.  fourth, frame 
to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical
"working set," or fraction of the total structure 
that should be present in primary store for immediate
access by the visible surface algorithm.  finally, 
the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent,
visible surface algorithm in which the computation 
time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.

reentrant polygon clipping

a new family of clipping algorithms is described.
 these algorithms are able to clip polygons 
against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three
dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which 
lie outside the volume.  in two dimensions the algorithms
permit clipping against irregular convex windows. 
 polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered
sequence of vertices without repetition of first 
and last, in marked contrast to representation as a
collection of edges as was heretofore the common 
procedure.  output polygons have an identical format,
with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe 
any newly-cut edge or edges.  the algorithms easily handle
the particularly difficult problem of detecting 
that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the
clipping window.  the algorithms described achieve 
considerable simplicity by clipping separately against
each clipping plane or window boundary.  code 
capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundary
is reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries. 
 each such reentrant stage of clipping need store only
two vertex values and may begin its processing 
as soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding
stage is ready.  because the same code is reentered 
for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping
against very complex window shapes is practical. 
 for perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane
truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping 
volume.  the two additional planes parallel to the projection
screen serve to limit the range of depth 
preserved through the projection.  a perspective projection
method which provides for arbitrary view 
angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping
planes is described.  this method is ideal 
for subsequent hidden-surface computations.

a computer generated aid for cluster analysis

a computer generated graphic method, which
can be used in conjunction with any hierarchical 
scheme of cluster analysis, is described and illustrated.
 the graphic principle used is the representation 
of the elements of a data matrix of similarities or dissimilarities
by computer printed symbols (of character 
overstrikes) of various shades of darkness, where a
dark symbol corresponds to a small dissimilarity. 
 the plots, applied to a data matrix before clustering
and to the rearranged matrix after clustering, 
show at a glance whether clustering brought forth any
distinctive clusters.  a well-known set of data 
consisting of the correlations of 24 psychological tests
is used to illustrate the comparison of groupings 
by four methods of factor analysis and two methods of cluster analysis.

conversational access to a 2048-word machine

lap6 is an on-line system running on a 2048-word linc which provides full 
facilities for text editing, automatic filing and file maintenance, and 
program preparation and assembly.  it focuses on the preparation and editing 
of continuously displayed 23,040-character text strings (manuscripts) which
can be positioned anywhere by the user and edited by simply adding
and deleting lines as though working directly on an elastic scroll.
other features are available through a uniform command set which itself can 
be augmented by the user.  the machine, although small,
aids program design by providing display scope and premarked
randomly addressable linc tapes as standard items, in an environment
similar to that of a sophisticated terminal.  the tapes are logically 
similar to a disk.  priority was given to the design of efficient
tape algorithms to minimize the limitations of the small memory.  techniques 
developed for handling scroll editing, filing, and the layered system 
structure are outlined.  lap6 is used by about 2000 people in 11 countries.  
its design was strongly influenced by performance criteria established in 
interviews held with linc users themselves during the specification period.

the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications system

a study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system.  it is
concluded that while, for certain values of system 
parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer (model), in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance.  analytical and simulation results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an m/d/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem
with a single exponential server (the computer). 
 analytical results include a general description of the
output process of an m/d/1 queue and the conditions 
under which this output process is approximately poisson.

an approach to the optimum design of computer graphics systems

display system 
************************
 systems

display system designers are faced with the
difficult task of selecting major subsystems in 
an intelligent way.  each subsystem is chosen from large
numbers of alternatives; the selection is based 
on considerations such as system response time, system
cost, and the distribution of data storage and 
processing between the graphics processor and its supporting
data processing system.  the work reported 
here develops an objective, quantitative design procedure
and helps give a better understanding of now 
to  configure display systems.  this is accomplished by
means of a mathematical model of a computer driven 
graphics system.  the parameters of the model are functions
of the capabilities of the graphics hardware 
and of the computational requirements of the graphics application.
 the model can be analyzed using numerical 
queueing analysis or simulation to obtain an average
response time prediction.  by combining the model 
with an optimization, the best graphics system configuration,
subject to a cost constraint, is found 
for several applications.  the optimum configurations
are in turn used to find general display system 
design guidelines.

a parametric algorithm for drawing pictures

an algorithm for drawing pictures of three-dimensional
objects, with surfaces made up of patches 
of quadric surfaces, is described.  the emphasis of
this algorithm is on calculating the intersections 
of quadric surfaces. a parameterization scheme is used.
 each quadric surface intersection curve (qsic) 
is represented as a set of coefficients and parameter
limits.  each value of the parameter represents 
at most two points, and these may easily be distinguished.
 this scheme can find the coordinates of points 
of even quartic (fourth-order) intersection curves, using
equations of no more than second order.  methods 
of parameterization for each type of osic are discussed,
as well as surface bounding and hidden surface 
removal.

optimal surface reconstruction from planar contours

in many scientific and technical endeavors,
a three-dimensional solid must be reconstructed 
from serial sections, either to aid in the comprehension
of the object's structure or to facilitate its 
automatic manipulation and analysis.  this paper presents
a general solution to the problem of constructing 
a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours. 
this surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, 
is constructed by separately determining an optimal
surface between each pair of consecutive contours.
 determining such a surface is reduced to the problem
of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed 
toroidal graph.  a new fast algorithm for finding such
cycles is utilized.  also developed is a closed-form 
expression, in term of the number of contour poin ts, for
an upper bound on the number of operations required 
to execute the algorithm.  an illustrated example which
involves the construction of a minimum area surface 
describing a human head is included.

computer photocomposition of technical text

in computer assisted typesetting by means of
photocomposition, special problems arise in highly 
technical material such as mathematical formulas.  new
solutions to several of these problems have been 
devised in the information system of the american institute
of physics.  they include: the representation 
of special characters (foreign alphabets, mathematical
symbols, etc.) not available on input keyboards 
or on the photocomposer; the generation of such symbols,
e.g. by overprinting; the precise positioning 
of accent marks (floating diacritics); line breaks,
i.e. words or formulas placed partly at the end of 
one line and partly at the beginning of the next;
and certain aspects of error correction.

representations for space planning

problems involving the arrangement of objects in two- 
or three-space where the objective function primarily consists
of derivatives of the distance between objects or their arrangement
are called space planning problems.  the representational
requirements for this problem area are defined and compared with current
computer graphic languages.  four alternative data structures
that allow automated space planning are described and compared.

improving programs by the introduction of recursion

a new technique of program transformation,
called "recursion in troduction," is described and 
applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems.
 by using recursion in troduction, algorithms 
which manipulate a stack are first translated into
recursive algorithms in which no stack operations 
occur.  these algorithms are then subjected to a second
transformation, a method of recursion elimination 
called "tabulation," to produce programs with a very
efficient running time.  in particular, it is shown 
how the fast linear pattern matching algorithm

on the design of display processors

the flexibility and power needed in the data
channel for a computer display are considered. 
 to work efficiently, such a channel must have a sufficient number
of instructions that it is best understood 
as a small processor rather than a powerful channel.
 as it was found that successive improvements to 
the display processor design lie on a circular path, by
making improvements one can return to the original 
simple design plus one new general purpose computer for
each trip around.  the degree of physical separation 
between display and parent computer is a key factor in display processor design.

a simply extended and modified batch
environment graphical system (sembegs)

sembegs is a complete batch environment graphical
system containing components for handling 
graphical data files, for displaying the contents of
these files on a variety of graphical hardware, 
and for performing graphical batch input operations.
 sembegs is easy to extend and modify to meet the 
growing needs of a large batch environment, and is even
extendable to a fully interactive system.  the 
paper presents the conceptual view of graphics leading
to the design of sembegs and outlines the major 
components

components of the system.  the design of sembegs is founded
upon the basic assumption that the true aim

rather than, as commonly held, to provide graphical 
input and output functional capabilities.  sembegs
is built around a basic graphical data management 
system (bagdams) which provides a common means of communicating
the descriptions of graphical entities 
 between the various components of sembegs.  bagdams
provides facilities for storing, retrieving, and 
manipulating the descriptions of graphical entities
provided by, and received by application programs,
graphics packages, and graphical devices.

brad: the brookhaven raster display

a multiconsole computer display system has
been designed that provides very rich displays at 
low unit cost.  each brad (brookhaven raster display)
console can plot tens of thousands of points, or 
up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second.  after
an initial display system investment of $50,000 
each display, with teletype, costs less than $3,000.
 the technique employed is that of programmatically 
generating a binary image of the desired display in a
computer.  the image is written on a rotating drum 
memory.  independent read heads continuously display
the picture, which is generated by swept horizontal 
lines.  a standard tv monitor serves as the display device.
 the technique has two drawbacks.  a computer 
must compute any image to be displayed.  also, the "pointing"
interaction is more difficult.  this is 
because the pointing function gives only the coordinates
of the point on the screen.  the inverse of 
the map generation process is required to calculate
the coordinates of the point on the screen.  the 
inverse of the map generation process is required to
calculate the coordinates at the selected point 
in the input space.

efficient algorithms for graph manipulation [h] (algorithm a447)

efficient algorithms are presented for partitioning
a graph into connected components, biconnected 
components and simple paths.  the algorithm for partitioning
of a graph into simple paths is iterative 
and each iteration produces a new path between two
vertices already on paths.  (the start vertex can 
be specified dynamically.)  if v is the number of vertices
and e is the number of edges, each algorithm 
requires time and space proportional to max (v,e)
when executed on a random access computer.

graphical input/output of nonstandard characters

a system developed at harvard for graphically
inputting and outputting nonstandard characters 
on a computer is printed.  in principle, the system
can deal with any orthography, although at present 
it is limited to 4000 chinese characters and some mathematical
symbols.  new characters can be added 
to the repertoire of the system by graphical input on
a display scope.  text inputting is accomplished 
via a display scope or a rand tablet.  the organization

the cyclic order property of vertices as an aid in scene analysis

a cyclic-order property is defined for bodies bounded by smooth-curved faces.
the property is shown to be useful for analyzing pictures of such bodies,
particularly when the line data extracted from the pictures are imperfect.
this property augments previously known grammatical rules that
determine the existence of three-dimensional bodies corresponding
to given two-dimensional line-structure data.

analysis of the availability of computer
systems using computer- aided algebra

analytical results, related to the availability
of a computer system constructed of unreliable 
processors, are presented in this paper.  these results
are obtained by using various computer-aided 
algebraic manipulation techniques.  a major purpose of
this paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties 
of obtaining analytical solutions to markov processes
can be considerably reduced by the application 
of symbol manipulation programs.  since many physical
systems can be modeled by markov and semi-markov 
processes, the potential range of application of these techniques
is much wider than the problem of availability 
analyzed here.
