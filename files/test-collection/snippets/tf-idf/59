is developed by network decomposition.  the 
models are formulated in terms of cpu:i/o and i/o:i/o overlap
and applied to the analysis of these problems. 
 the percentage performance improvement from cpu:i/o

s

the security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  a set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  the model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.

tests of probabilistic models for propagation of roundoff errors

in any prolonged computation it is generally
assumed that the accumulated effect of roundoff 
errors is in some sense statistical.  the purpose of this
paper is to give precise descriptions of certain 
probabilistic models for roundoff error, and then to
describe a series of experiments for testing the 
validity of these models.  it is concluded that the models
are in general very good.  discrepancies are 
both rare and mild.  the test techniques can also be
used to experiment with various types of special

in 1977.  the 1100 series hardware architecture 
is based on a 36-bit word, ones complement structure
which obtains one operand from storage and one from 
a high-speed register, or two operands from high-speed
registers.  the 1100 operating system is designed 
to support a symmetrical multiprocessor configuration
simultaneously providing multiprogrammed batch,

optimizing the performance of a relational algebra database interface

an approach 
************************
 interface

an approach for implementing a "smart" interface
to support a relational view of data is proposed. 
 the basic idea is to employ automatic programming techniques
so that the interface analyzes and efficiently 
refines the high level query specification supplied by
the user.  a relational algebra interface, called 
squiral, which was designed using this approach, is described
in detail. squiral seeks to minimize query 
response time and space utilization by: (1) performing
global query optimization, (2) exploiting disjoint 
and pipelined concurrency, (3) coordinating sort orders
in temporary relations, (4) employing directory 
analysis, and (5) maintaining locality in page references.
 algorithms for implementing the operators 
of e. f. codd's relational algebra are presented, and
a methodology for composing them to optimize the 
performance of a particular user query is described.

a critical failure of current software system
design and implementation 
************************

design and implementation methodology is that 
the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented.  in this paper 
the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed.  a system which integrates performance evaluation
with design and implementation is described. 
 this system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  the source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines.  using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

 plexus is designed to complement neurophysiological research
so that the systematic development of neural 
models can be coordinated with experimental work.  plexus
networks are built up from components representing 
individual neurons, external stimuli, and interconnecting
fibers, each component being of a relatively 
detailed nature.  provision is also made for the use of
experimental data as input to a network.  convenient 
means for specification and modification of a network and
extensive error-checking capabilities are provided. 
data resulting from the simulation of a network may be
analyzed by a variety of techniques ranging from 
examinations of the gross characteristics of the data to
the determination of detailed statistical properties.

aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction
which is important in conceptualizing the real

objects into a higher-level object.  a new data 
type, called aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies

************************
 databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  to main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  it 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  a top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  it is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail, should be incorporated 
into programming languages.

optimal space allocation on disk storage devices

when the amount of space required for file storage
exceeds the amount which can be kept on-line, 
decisions must be made as to which files are to be permanently
resident and which mountable.  these decisions 
will affect the number of mount requests issued to the
operators.  this is often a bottleneck in a computing 
facility, and reducing the number of mounts thus decreases
turnaround time.  an optimization model for 
the assignment of files to disk packs, and packs to either
resident or nonresident status is presented. 
 heuristics are suggested for those cases in which
it is inefficient to compute the actual optimum.

this paper is a separately published introduction
to a main report which analyzes the features

************************
.  this introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  after some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  the first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  the problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  the use of cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  this
section also assesses the effect of the data base 
task group proposals.  the final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

advanced cryptographic techniques for computers

cryptographic techniques which can be used to
maintain the confidentiality of information processed 
by computers are dealt with.  special emphasis is paid
to the unique characteristics of computer files 
that make many cryptographic methods of little use.
 relative security, costs, and preferred methods 
are included in this paper.

 or other attributes of the plot.  this enables plots of any
complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules.  the
basic syntax of amesplot is outlined, and a brief description is given
of its current utility software, consisting of "macros" to produce
self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots,
map coastlines, and 3-d plots.  the system was formulate

and it should be fully integrable with user's program written
in most conventional higher languages.  the functions of positioning,
locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of
axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically
by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  the structuring 
of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots

transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or 
subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  the user 
may interact freely with amesplot at three levels, enabling him to construct 
his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and
to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.

hierarchical storage in information retrieval

a probabilistic analysis is employed to determine
the effect of hierarchical storage organizations 
on information retrieval operations.  the data storage
hardware is assumed to consist on n-levels of 
linearly connected memory hardware with increasing data
access times and increasing data storage capabilities. 
 a system might, for example, consist of fast semiconductor
memory, computer core memory, extended core 
storage, disk

to predict the effect of such a system on

the evolution of the dec system 10

the dec system 10, also known as the pdp-10, evolved
from the pdp-6 (circa 1963) over five generations 
of implementations to presently include systems covering
a price range of five to one.  the origin and 
evolution of the hardware, operating system, and languages
are described in terms of technological change, 
user requirements, and user developments. the pdp-10's
contributions to computing technology include: 
accelerating the transition from batch oriented to time
sharing computing systems; transferring hardware 
technology within dec (and elsewhere) to minicomputer
design and manufacturing; supporting minicomputer 
hardware and software development; and serving

automated welfare client-tracking and service
integration: the political economy of computing

the impacts of an automated client-tracking
system on the clients, caseworkers, administrators, 
and operations of the welfare agencies that use it are
reported.  the major impact of this system was 
to enhance the administrative  attractiveness of the
using agencies in the eyes of funders rather than 
to increase their internal administrative efficiency. 
this impact is a joint product of both the technical 
features of the computer-based system and of the organizational
demands placed upon different agencies, 
administrators, and caseworkers.  it illustrates the
way "successful" automated information systems fit 
the political economies of the groups that use them.

management utilization of computers in american local governments

traditional concepts of management information
systems (mis) bear little relation to the information 
systems currently in use by top management in most us local
governments.  what exists is management-oriented 
computing, involving the use of relatively unsophisticated
applications.  despite the unsophisticated 
nature of these systems, management use of computing is
surprisingly common, but also varied in its extent 
among local governments.  management computing is most
prevalent in those governments with professional 
management practices where top management is supportive
of computing and tends to control computing 
************************
s to control computing decisions 
and where department users have less control over design
and implementation activities.  finally, management 
computing clearly has impacts for top managers, mostly

consumer difficulties with computerized transactions: 
an empirical investigation

the prevalence with which errors may be encountered by the 
end targets of a computerized process is assessed.  how many and
what type of errors occur?  how easily are they corrected?  what
is the reaction of consumers to errors-to a failure to correct
them?  what can be learned by designers of large management packages
from such data? results 
************************

from such data? results show that with the present state of the
art, approximately 40 percent of individuals (or households) having
average contacts with different types of accounts experience one
or more errors per year.  eighty percent relate to billing.  attempts
to correct errors often turned out to be difficult and not always
successful. there appears to be some conflict between computer-using
organizations and their public.  also the role of poor man
agement packages including poor software is indicated.  while most
management systems may be adequate, results

 may be adequate, results of the survey raise
concerns about the timeliness and the number of designs of very

a progressive 
************************

a progressive acyclic digraph (pad) algorithm accepts are requests and
maintains a graph in an acyclic state.  when a request creates a cycle,
nodes are, "detached" until the new are can be entered acyclically
this process is important in certain areas of database implementation
in which there are constraints on the permissible sequences
of actions. two pad algorithms are presented; one uses a simple
path matrix representation and the other uses a list with an
"artificial gradient."  experiments suggest that for large n the second
is considerably faster, though both are asymptotically o(nr),
where n is the number of nodes and r is the expected number
of nodes reachable along paths from any given node.

a correctness proof of a topology information
main tenance protocol for a distributed computer 
network

in order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  one of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  the topology
information protocol that was implemented on the 
merit computer network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  it is based on baran's "hot
potato heuristic routing doctrine."  a correctness 
proof of this topology information protocol is also presented.

dynamic response time prediction for computer networks

if the ultimate aim of a computing network
is resource sharing, then the human component as 
well as the technical component of networking must
be fully investigated to achieve this goal.  this 
research is a first step toward assisting the user in participating
in the vast store of resources available 
on a network. analytical, simulation, and statistical performance
evaluation tools are employed to investigate 
the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitor
that is capable of providing comparative response 
time information for users wishing to process various
computing applications at some network computing 
node.  the research clearly reveals that sufficient
system data are currently obtainable, at least for 
the five diverse arpa network systems studied in detail,
to describe and predict the response time for 
network time-sharing systems as it depends on some
measure of
