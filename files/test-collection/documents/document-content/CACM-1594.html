an algorithm for generating permutations an algorithm is described which under repeated application generates all permutations of k elements only the previously generated permutation the constant k and a temporary index are needed starting with a particular ordering of k elements abcd repeated application of the algorithm will generate k 1 additional permutations by k 1 successive rotations from the initial circular ordering of k objects another circular ordering can be obtained by rotating the k 1 lowest elements for each new k 1 circular ordering another k 2 can be obtained by rotating the k 2 lowest elements by continuing in this manner applications of the algorithm will generate all k 1 circular orderings or since each circular ordering yields k permutations the algorithm generates all k permutations cacm may 1967 langdon jr g g ca670508 jb february 28 197810 35 am 1594 5 1594 1594 5 1594 1594 5 1594 2087 5 1594 2189 5 1594 3188 5 1594 1594 6 1594 1594 6 1594 1594 6 1594 2087 6 1594 3191 6 1594 521 6 1594 612 6 1594
