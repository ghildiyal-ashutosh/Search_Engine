translation equations input limited transduction expressions or translation equations are used to describe the syntax and left context sensitive semantics for context free languages a formal procedure is given for deriving from a set of translation equations the specifications for a pushdown translator the translator consists of mealy form finite state automata interacting by means of a pushdown stack within the framework described string recognition and parsing may be treated as special cases of the translation problem cacm february 1970 vere s automata turing machines regular expression transduction expression context free languages translation recognizers parsing meta compilers pushdown transducer syntax directed compilers finite state automata 4 10 4 12 4 20 5 22 ca700203 jb february 14 1978 10 49 am 1323 4 2112 1358 4 2112 1380 4 2112 1665 4 2112 1781 4 2112 1787 4 2112 1989 4 2112 2112 4 2112 2534 4 2112 2541 4 2112 2698 4 2112 2733 4 2112 2820 4 2112 3073 4 2112 3155 4 2112 2112 5 2112 2112 5 2112 2112 5 2112 799 5 2112
