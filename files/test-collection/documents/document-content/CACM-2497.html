synchronizing processors with memory content generated interrupts implementations of the lock unlock method of synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor system usually require uninterruptable memory pause type instructions an interlock scheme called read interlock which does not require memory pause instructions has been developed for a dual dec pdp 10 system with real time requirements the read interlock method does require a special read interlock instruction in the repertoire of the processors and a special read interlock cycle in the repertoire of the memory modules when a processor examines a lock a memory location with a read interlock instruction it will be interrupted if the lock was already set examining a lock immediately sets it if it was not already set this event sequence is a read interlock cycle writing into a lock clears it having the processor interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of branching is advantageous if the branch would have resulted in an effective interrupt cacm june 1973 hill j c interrupts supervisors monitors debugging parallel processing associative memories microprogramming 4 32 6 29 ca730603 jb january 23 1978 3 29 pm 1458 4 2497 1523 4 2497 1603 4 2497 1698 4 2497 1747 4 2497 1748 4 2497 1854 4 2497 1877 4 2497 1960 4 2497 2377 4 2497 2378 4 2497 2497 4 2497 2497 4 2497 2534 4 2497 2558 4 2497 2625 4 2497 2632 4 2497 2840 4 2497 2941 4 2497 3105 4 2497 3144 4 2497 1471 5 2497 2182 5 2497 2497 5 2497 2497 5 2497 2497 5 2497
