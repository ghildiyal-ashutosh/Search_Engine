a note on the calculation working set size finite length reference string of arbitrary structure are considered and an exact expression for average working set size in terms of corrected interreference interval statistics is derived an example is discussed upper and lower bounds are obtained and the average working set size function is shown to be efficiently obtained for a set of page sizes in a single pass of the reference string this work follows the developments of a paper by denning and schwartz who consider infinite length reference strings which satisfy certain statistical properties and who derive an expression relating the asymptotic average working set size to the asymptotic missing page rate function under working set replacement cacm october 1974 slutz d r traiger i l working set model paging program behavior 4 3 ca741003 jb january 16 1978 12 56 pm 2374 4 2595 2380 4 2595 2450 4 2595 2595 4 2595 2996 4 2595 3006 4 2595 3067 4 2595 2373 5 2595 2595 5 2595 2595 5 2595 2595 5 2595 2996 5 2595 3006 5 2595 3067 5 2595 1751 6 2595 1751 6 2595 1751 6 2595 1884 6 2595 2374 6 2595 2374 6 2595 2373 6 2595 2373 6 2595 2373 6 2595 2595 6 2595 2595 6 2595 2595 6 2595 2682 6 2595 2863 6 2595 2864 6 2595 3006 6 2595
