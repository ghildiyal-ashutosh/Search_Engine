pdel a language for partial differential equations conventional computer methods available to solve continuous system problems characterized by partial differential equations are very time consuming and cumbersome a convenient easy to learn and to use high level problem oriented language to solve and study partial differential equation problems has been designed a practical translator for the language has also been designed and a working version of it has been constructed for a significant portion of the language this partial differential equation language pdel is outlined and the highlights of the translator are briefly summarized cacm march 1970 cardenas a f karplus w j problem oriented or digital simulation language partial differential equations translator pl 1 preprocessor pl 1 finite difference algorithms 3 1 3 2 4 22 5 17 ca700307 jb february 13 1978 4 18 pm 1379 4 2091 1503 4 2091 1542 4 2091 1683 4 2091 1693 4 2091 1693 4 2091 1781 4 2091 1781 4 2091 1781 4 2091 1787 4 2091 1836 4 2091 1836 4 2091 1860 4 2091 1945 4 2091 1945 4 2091 2015 4 2091 2060 4 2091 2060 4 2091 2061 4 2091 2061 4 2091 2082 4 2091 2091 4 2091 2091 4 2091 2091 4 2091 2152 4 2091 2179 4 2091 2179 4 2091 2340 4 2091 2356 4 2091 2546 4 2091 2546 4 2091 2603 4 2091 2698 4 2091 2698 4 2091 2708 4 2091 2708 4 2091 2824 4 2091 2982 4 2091 2986 4 2091 3045 4 2091 3045 4 2091 3093 4 2091 1366 5 2091 1477 5 2091 1491 5 2091 2091 5 2091 2091 5 2091 2091 5 2091
