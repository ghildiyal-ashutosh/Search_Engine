interpolation search -a log logn search

interpolation search is a method of retrieving
a desired record by key in an ordered file by 
using the value of the key and the statistical distribution
of the keys.  it is shown that on the average 
log logn file accesses are required to retrieve a key,
assuming that the n keys are uniformly distributed. 
 the number of extra accesses is also estimated and shown
to be very low.  the same holds if the cumulative 
distribution function of the keys is known.  computational
experiments confirm these results.

a user authentication scheme not requiring secrecy in the computer

in many computer operating systems a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system.  the system compares
this password with one recorded in a password 
table which is available to only the authentication
program.  the integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret.  in this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer.    all aspects of the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  the scheme is based
on using a function h which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  this function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  the intruder may know all about h and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert h to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  this paper discusses

situations.  among these are inverse document frequency

optimizing decision trees through heuristically guided search

optimal decision table conversion has been
tackled in the literature using two approaches,

technique is quite effective, but its time and 
space requirements are independent of how "easy" the

to produce good, quasi optimal solutions.  the branch-and-bound
technique uses a good heuristic to direct

, but is cluttered up by an enormous search
space, since the number of solutions increases 
with the number of test variables according to a double 
exponential.  in this paper we suggest a heuristically 
guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic
programming, recognizes identical subproblems but 
which can be used to find both optimal and quasi optimal
solutions.  the heuristic search method introduced 
in this paper combines the positive aspects of the above
two techniques.  compressed tables with a large 
number of variables can be handled without deriving expanded tables first.

the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications system

a study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic

and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system.  it is
concluded that while, for certain values of system 
parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer (model), in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance.  analytical and simulation results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an m/d/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem
with a single exponential server (the computer).

median split trees: a fast lookup technique for frequently occuring keys

split trees are a new technique for searching sets
of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions. 
 a split tree is a binary search tree each node of which
contains two key values-a node value which is 
a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split
value which partitions the remaining keys (with 
respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and
right subtrees.  a median split tree (mst) uses 
the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split
value to force the search tree to be perfectly 
balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation
of the tree and high search speed.  unlike 
frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a
successful search of an mst is log n bounded and 
very stable around minimal values.  further, an mst
can be built for a given key ordering and set of 
frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n2 for an
optimum binary search tree.  a discussion of the 
application of mst's to dictionary lookup for english is
presented, and the performance obtained is contrasted 
with that of other techniques.

data filtering applied to information storage and retrieval applications

************************
 applications

manipulation of data strings is the most complex
processing function in information storage 
and retrieval applications.  data 
************************
 applications.  data string manipulation
is discussed within the context of an interpretive 
processing environment controlled by the use of procedural
directives.  the sequence of procedural directives 
is derived from a job assumed to be expressed in a user-oriented
source language.  each data string with 
the structured data environment (data bank) is explicitly
or implicitly related to a format declaration
residing in a format library.  the processing mechanics
associated with data string manipulation is developed 
in accordance with a generalized data filtering concept.
 this results in the implementation of a two-part 
data filter module that satisfies internal processing
functions by filtering data strings through format 
declarations associated with its input and output ports.

canonical structure in attribute based file organization

a new file structure for attribute based retrieval
is proposed in this paper.  it allows queries 
involving arbitrary boolean functions of the attribute-value
pairs to be processed without taking intersections 
of lists.  the structure is highly dependent on the
way in which the file is to be used and is uniquely 
determined by the specification of the allowed queries.
 thus, for example, the structure for retrieval 
on the basis of ranges of values of a given attribute would
be very different from one where only retrieval 
on the basis of a single value is permitted.  the file
organization being proposed is based on the atoms 
of a boolean algebra generated by the queries.  the desirable
properties claimed for this structure are 
proved, and file maintenance questions are discussed.

multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching

this paper develops the multidimensional binary
search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality 
of the search space) as a data structure for storage of
information to be retrieved by associative searches. 
the k-d tree is defined and examples are given. it
is shown to be quite in its storage requirements. 
 a significant advantage of this structure is that a single
data structure can handle many types of queries 
very efficiently.  various utility algorithms are developed;
their proven average running times in an 
n record file are: insertion, o (log n); deletion of
the root, o (n^(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, 
o (log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance
of searches), o (n log n).  search algorithms 
are given for partial match queries with t keys specified
[proven maximum running time of o (n^(k-t)/k)] 
and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average
running time of o (log n).]  these performances 
far surpass the best currently known algorithms for
these tasks.  an algorithm is presented to handle 
any general intersection query. the main focus of this

k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications,
and examples of potential uses are given.

a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  the use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  in this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value

as guides in mechanizing the acm repository. 
 the main features of the information system are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  the first contribution
to the acm repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  these
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
the catalog is scheduled to appear in computing reviews.
 the indexing system is described in detail. 
 the main catalog is used to describe the documents,

a selective traversal algorithm for binary search trees

the problem of selecting data items from
a binary search tree according to a list of range 
conditions is considered.  the process of visiting a
minimal number of nodes to retrieve data satisfying 
the range conditions is called selective traversal.  presented
in this paper is an algorithm for selective 
traversal which uses a tag field for each node in the
tree.  the algorithm is particularly useful and 
efficient when examination of data is more time
consuming than examination of a tag field.

hardware is assumed to consist on n-levels of 
linearly connected memory hardware with increasing data
access times and increasing data storage capabilities. 
 a system might, for example, consist of fast semiconductor
memory, computer core memory, extended core 
storage, disk memory, and data cells.  equations are derived
to predict the effect of such a system on 
data access times using sequential files, random access files,
and structured files employing multiple-hierarchical 
linked lists.

theoretical considerations in information retrieval systems

information storage

information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three 
************************
s are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, 
************************
,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  for identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by goffman, verhoeff and belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  for searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  the inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  one is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a

heuristic procedures

s

heuristic procedures are presented which have
been developed to perform inferences by generalizing 
from available information.  the procedures make use
of a similarity structure which is imposed on the 
data base using nonnumerical clustering algorithms.  they
are implemented in a model fact retrieval system 
which uses a formal

which uses a formal query language and a property-list data
structure.  a program of experiments is described 
wherein the procedures are used with test data bases
which are altered by deleting part of the data and 
by purposely introducing false data.  it is found that
the system can infer the correct response under 
a variety of conditions involving incomplete and inconsistent data.

context trees provide a convenient way of
storing data which is to be viewed as a hierarchy 
of contexts.  this note presents an algorithm which improves
on previous context tree retrieval algorithms. 
it is based on the observation that in typical uses context
changes are infrequent relative to retrievals, 
so that data can be cached to speed up retrieval.  a retrieval
is started from the position of the previous 
retrieval and auxiliary structures are built up to make
