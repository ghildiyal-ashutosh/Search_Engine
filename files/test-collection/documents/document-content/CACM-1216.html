symbolic derivatives without list processing subroutines or recursion a routine has been developed which computes and prints out the symbolic derivative of an absolutely continuous elementary function of one or several variables no use is made of list processing languages the chain rule is applied and the result is edited to produce results as elegant and efficient as those obtained by hand computation a subset may be imbeded in a formula translator to introduce a differentiation operator into an algebraic programming language cacm august 1965 smith p j ca650808 jb march 6 1978 8 18 pm 1028 4 1216 1028 4 1216 1216 4 1216 1216 4 1216 1216 4 1216 1278 4 1216 1278 4 1216 1347 4 1216 1347 4 1216 1392 4 1216 1396 4 1216 1396 4 1216 1396 4 1216 1536 4 1216 964 4 1216 1028 5 1216 1029 5 1216 1216 5 1216 1216 5 1216 1216 5 1216 561 5 1216
