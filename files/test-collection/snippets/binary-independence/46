neater2: a pl/i source statement reformatter

neater2 accepts a pl/i source program and operates on it to produce
a reformatted version.  when in the logical mode, neater2 indicates
the logical structure of the source program in the indentation
pattern of its output.  logic errors discovered through neater2
logical analysis are discovered much more economically than is possible
through compilation and trial runs.  a number of options are

performance of height-balanced trees

this paper presents the results of simulations
that investigate the performance of height-balanced 
(hb[k]) trees.  it is shown that the only statistic
of hb[1] trees (avl trees) that is a function of 
the size of the tree is the time to search for an item
in the tree.  for sufficiently large trees, the 
execution times of all procedures for maintaining hb[1]
trees are independent of the size of the tree. 
 in particular, an average of .465 restructures are required
per insertion, with an average of 2.78 nodes 
revisited to restore the hb[1] property; an average of
 .214 restructures are required per deletion, with 
an average of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the hb[1]
property.  moreover,the execution times of procedures 
for maintaining hb[k] trees, for k>1, are also independent
of the size of the tree except for the average 
number of nodes revisited on a delete operation in
order to restore the hb[k] property on trace back. 
 the cost of maintaining hb[k] trees drops sharply as the
allowable imbalance (k) increases.  both analytical 
and experimental results that show the cost of maintaining
hb[k] trees as a function of k are discussed.

the next 700 programming languages 

a family of unimplemented computing languages
is described that is intended to span differences 
of application area by a unified framework.  this framework
dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined 
names, and the

relationships.  within this framework the 
design of a specific language splits into two independent
parts.  one is the choice of written appearances 
of programs (or more generally, their physical representation).
 the other is the choice of the abstract 
entities (such as numbers, character-strings, lists
of them, functional relations among them) that can 
be referred to in the language.  the system is biased
towards "expressions" rather than "statements." 
 it includes a nonprocedural(purely functional) subsystem
that aims to expand the class of users' needs

a nonrecursive method of syntax specification

the use of the kleene regular expression notation
for describing algebraic language syntax, 
in particular of algol, is described in this paper. 
a fortran ii computer program for carrying out the 
elimination algorithm of gorn,similar to gaussian elimination
for linear systems of algebraic equations,

languages, including some sublanguage of algol.  
a hand calculation result of the application of the algorithm
to all of algol is given, thus expressing 
the revised algol 1960 syntax in completely nonrecursive
terms, as far as its context-free portion is 
concerned.  this description in many ways is far more

a policy-driven scheduler for a time-sharing system

the service received by a process from a time-sharing
operating system can be characterized 
by a resource count sum{w[i]r[ij]} where r[ij] is the
number of units of service received by process 
i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of the
service.  each class of users can be characterized 
************************
s can be characterized 
by a policy function which specifies the amount of service
a user who belongs to this class should receive 
as a function of time.  priority changes dynamically
as a function of the difference between the service 
promised to the user by the policy function and the service
he actually receives.  a scheduling and swapping 
algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process
above its policy function will provide the specified 
level of service.  overhead can be reduced by avoiding
swaps of process which have received at least 
his level of service.  the algorithm has been implemented
in a general purpose operating system, and 
it has provided

automatic derivation of microsentences

the decomposition of long complex english sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  to explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the harvard multipath analysis program.  the basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  a program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 the authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems, they may have practical

simulation of radioisotope scans by computer

in radioisotope scanning, a field which is assuming
increasing importance in medical diagnosis, 
the scan is a two-dimensional pattern made up of dots.
 areas of increased source activity are represented 
on the scan by areas of increased dot density.  to study
the output of scanners with various characteristics, 
a program which simulates radioisotope scans has been
written  for a pdp-1 computer with auxiliary disk 
storage and cathode ray tube display.  past and present
research using the output of the simulator has 
shown the flexibility of the system to be important.

user program measurement in a time-shared environment

a general discussion of the measurement of
software systems is followed by a description of 
a hardware and software scheme for measuring user programs
in a time-shared environment.  the tx-2 computer 
at mit lincoln laboratory was used for the implementation
of such a system and the characteristics of 
this implementation are reported.  a scenario showing
the system in use is presented.  finally, it is 
shown how other time-sharing systems may provide similar measuring facilities.

a study of storage partitioning using a mathematical model of locality

both fixed and dynamic storage partitioning
procedures are examined for use in multiprogramming 
systems.  the storage requirement of programs is modeled
as a stationary gaussian process.  experiments 
justifying this model are described.  by means of this
model dynamic storage partitioning is shown to 
provide substantial increases in storage utilization
and operating efficiency over fixed partitioning.

transfer costs.  this paper presents a model in which

and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed

each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  one of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the

the current role of computers in automatic

reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
and of the mechanization of documentation 
processes has not been fulfilled.  a new dynamic document
environment is then outlined in which clustered
files are searched and information is retrieved following
an interactive user-controlled search process. 
 methods are described for an automatic query modification
based on user needs, and for a continuous 
reorganization of the stored information as a function of
earlier file processing and of normal collection 
growth.  the proposed procedures provide powerful tools
