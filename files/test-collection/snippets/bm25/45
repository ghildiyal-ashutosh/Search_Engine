interval arithmetic determinant evaluation
and its use in testing for a chebyshev system

two recent papers, one by hansen and one by
hansen and r. r. smith, have shown how interval 
arithmetic (i.) can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations.  in the present paper 
a method proposed by hasen and r. r. smith is compared
with straightforward use of i. in determinant 
evaluation.  computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
i. for determinant evaluation.  an application using

expanding the editing function in language data processing

************************
,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  applications are described,

experiments in automatic learning for a multipurpose heuristic program

an automatic learning capability has been developed
and implemented for use with the multiple 
(multipurpose program that learns) heuristic tree-searching
program, which is presently being applied 
to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus.
multiple's proving program (pp) uses two evaluation 
functions to guide its search for a proof of whether
or not a particular goal is achievable.  thirteen 
general features of predicate calculus clauses were created
for use in the automatic learning of better 
evaluation functions for pp.  a multiple regression
program was used to produce optimal coefficients 
for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features.
 also, automatic data-handling routines were 
written for passing data between the learning program
and the proving program, and for analyzing and 
summarizing results.  data was generally collected for
learning (regression analysis) from the experience 
of pp.  a number of experiments were performed to test
the effectiveness and generality of the learning 
program. results showed that the learning produced dramatic
improvements in the solutions to problems 
which were in the same domain as those used for collection
learning data.  learning was also shown to 
generalize successfully to domains other than those used
for data collection.  another experiment demonstrated 
that the learning program could simultaneously improve
performance on problems in a specific

on problems in a variety of domains.  some variations

automatic parsing for content analysis

although automatic syntactic and semantic analysis is not yet possible for

this provides a degree of coverage for content analysis variables which

problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily

useful for the comparison it affords between observed

median split trees: a fast lookup technique for frequently occuring keys

split trees are a new technique for searching sets
of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions. 
 a split tree is a binary search tree each node of which
contains two key values-a node value which is 
a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split
value which partitions the remaining keys (with 
respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and
right subtrees.  a median split tree (mst) uses 
the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split
value to force the search tree to be perfectly 
balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation
of the tree and high search speed.  unlike 
frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a
successful search of an mst is log n bounded and 
very stable around minimal values.  further, an mst
can be built for a given key ordering and set of 
frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n2 for an
optimum binary search tree.  a discussion of the 
application of mst's to dictionary lookup for english is
presented, and the performance obtained is contrasted 
with that of other techniques.

multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching

this paper develops the multidimensional binary
search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality 
of the search space) as a data structure for storage of
information to be retrieved by associative searches. 
the k-d tree is defined and examples are given. it
is shown to be quite in its storage requirements. 
 a significant advantage of this structure is that a single
data structure can handle many types of queries 
very efficiently.  various utility algorithms are developed;
their proven average running times in an 
n record file are: insertion, o (log n); deletion of
the root, o (n^(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, 
o (log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance
of searches), o (n log n).  search algorithms 
are given for partial match queries with t keys specified
[proven maximum running time of o (n^(k-t)/k)] 
and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average
running time of o (log n).]  these performances 
far surpass the best currently known algorithms for
these tasks.  an algorithm is presented to handle 
any general intersection query. the main focus of this
paper theoretical.  it is felt, however, that 
k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications,
and examples of potential uses are given.

a model for type checking

most current programming languages treat computation

compilation and execution, the following question 
then arises: is a program properly constructed so that
its operations and operands are compatible?  the 
activity of answering this question is usually called
type checking.  this paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions of abstraction and application of functions.

in a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing

from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  an approach based on

indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents.

general performance analysis of key-to-address
transformation methods using an abstract file 
concept

this paper presents a new approach to the analysis
of performance of the various key-to-address 
transformation methods.  in this approach the keys in
a file are assumed to have been selected from the 
key space according to a certain probabilistic selection
algorithm.  all files with the same number of 
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance with the algorithm, and the 
average performance of the transformation methods on
these files will be used as the potential of these 
methods.  using this analysis, methods with the same overall
performance can be classified and key distributions 
partial to certain transformations can be identified.
 all this can be done analytically.  the approach 
is applied to a group of transformation methods
using files whose keys are selected randomly.

multi-attribute retrieval with combined indexes

in this paper a file organization scheme designed to
replace the use of the popular secondary index filing scheme
(or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described.
through the use of redundancy and storing 
keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations
of secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve
all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of
fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may
be used for many combinations of values and a combination of
buckets may be required for a given query.  the method which, in its
degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing
scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination
of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination
of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection
of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field
only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index
field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  redundancy, in some 
cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. in the general case, 
trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.

a series of clinical laboratory codes have been
developed to accept and store urin analysis, blood 
chemistry, and hematology test results for automatic
data processing.  the codes, although constructed 
as part of a computerized hospital simulation, have been
able to handle the results of every laboratory 
test that they have encountered.  the unique feature of
these codes is that they can accept conventionally 
recorded qualitative as well as quantitative test results.
 consequently, clinical test results need 
not be arbitrarily stratified, standardized, or altered
in any way to be coded.  this paper describes 
how the codes were developed and presents a listing of the
urin analysis codes.  five criteria used in developing 
the codes are outlined and the problem of multiple-synonymous
terminology is discussed.  a solution to 
the problem is described.  flexible, computer-produced,
composite laboratory reports are also discussed, 
along with reproduction of such a report. the paper concludes
that even though many problems remain unsolved, 
the next ten years could witness the emergence of a practical
automated information system in the laboratory.

 approach to converting
limited-entry decision tables to computer

this paper modifies an earlier algorithm for
converting decision tables into flowcharts which 
minimize subsequent execution time when compiled into
a computer program.  the algorithms considered 
in this paper perform limited search and, accordingly,
do not necessarily result in globally optimal 
solutions.  however, the greater search effort needed
to obtain a globally optimal solution for complex 
decision tables is usually not justified by sufficient
savings in execution time.  there is an analogy 
between the problem of converting decision tables into
efficient flowcharts and the well-understood problem 
in information theory of noiseless coding.

of search under certain conditions and in proposing
additional conditions to be added to the decision 
table.  finally, the information algorithm is compared
with an algorithm proposed in a recent paper by

a note on information organization and storage

since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 a general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  there are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  the use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 the results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

a card format for reference files in information processing

this paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  an 80-column ibm card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  the format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  the reference
material includes basically an index, 
************************
 basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
the identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source of the reference.  the 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment,
machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing.

horner's rule for the evaluation of general closed queueing networks

the solution of separable closed queueing networks
requires the evaluation of homogeneous multinomial 
expressions.  the number of terms in those expressions
grows combinatorially with the size of the network 
such that a direct summation may become impractical.  an
algorithm is given which does not show a combinatorial 
operation count.  the algorithm is based on a generalization
of horner's rule for polynomials.  it is 
also shown how mean queue size and throughput an be obtained
at negligible extra cost once the normalization 
constant is evaluated.

a rapid method for digital filtering

since much of the computer time spent in time-series
analysis is used for multiplications, 
a minimum multiplication method was devised for digital

data.  the filters are constructed from a succession 
of readily analyzable components in a manner that facilitates
cascading.  the repertoire of frequency

improving the access time for random access files

clustering in the key set is decreased by
smoothing the key-to-address transformation, and 
by adding shadow buckets to an open chaining file.  the
keys are pre-hashed before the address division, 
to remove the effect of sequential properties in the
key set.  shadow buckets in the key search sequence 
reduce the effect of nonuniformity in file loading,
and decrease the number of maximum probes needed 
to locate a record.  the combined effects of these techniques
lead to improved file performance for secondary 
storage devices, as shown by empirical studies.

a program for the syntactic analysis of english sentences

a program is described which produces syntactic
analyses of english sentences with respect 
to a transformational grammar.  the main features of the
analyzer are that it uses only a limited dictionary 
of english words and that it pursues all analysis paths
simultaneously while processing the sentence 
from left to right.  the form of representation used
for the dictionary and the grammar is indicated 
and an outline account is given of the analysis procedure.
 techniques for keeping the size of the analysis 
record within reasonable limits and for avoiding the need
for dynamic application of certain transformational 
rules are described.   a number of examples of output
produced by the program are given.  the output 
includes timing information.

a graph formulation of a school scheduling algorithm

the problem classically titled "the examination
schedule problem" takes various forms in the 
literature.  most of these formulations can be presented
in the terminology of classical network theory. 
 one such formulation is:  given a nondirected network,
partition its nodes into a minimal number of 
subsets such that no two members of the same subset
are connected by anarc.  an obvious lower limit 
to this number is the size of the largest strongly connected
subgraph.  kirchgassner proved that an upper 
limit is this size plus one.  one logical extension of
the previous work is the introduction of variable 
length examinations where w(i) is the number of periods
for exam i.  the object of this paper is to generalize 
the definition of largest strongly connected subgraph
to include the weighting of nodes, to present an 
approximate algorithm which usually finds the largest
strongly connected subgraph, and to discuss the 
application of this algorithm to the solution of
school scheduling and exam scheduling problems.
