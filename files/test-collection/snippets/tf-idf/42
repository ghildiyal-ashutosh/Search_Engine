expanding the editing function in language data processing

in automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  applications are described,
such processes as factor analysis.  applications 
are described, such as the quick, unbiased evaluation
of a large volume of incoming mail or telegrams, 
yielding summary reports not possible for either
humans or computers to produce alone.

an application of heuristic search methods to edge and contour detection

this paper presents a method for detecting edges
and contours in noisy pictures.  the properties 
of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge
detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing 
the given figure of merit.  this problem can be represented
as a shortest path problem on a graph and 
can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms.
 the relations between this representation of 
the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach
are discussed, showing that the graph search 
method can lead to substantial improvements in computing
time.  moreover, if heuristic search methods 
are used, the computing time will depend on the amount
of noise in the picture.  some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the separation 
of touching objects.

application of game tree searching techniques
to sequential pattern recognition

a sequential pattern recognition (spr) procedure
does not test all the features of a pattern 
at once.  instead, it selects a feature to be tested.  after
receiving the result of that test, the procedure 
either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another
feature to be tested, etc.  medical diagnosis 
is an example of spr.  in this paper the authors suggest
that spr be viewed as a one-person game played 
against nature (chance).  virtually all the powerful techniques
developed for searching two-person, strictly 
competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either
directly or by analogy into spr procedures. 
 in particular, one can incorporate the "mini average
backing-up procedure" and the "gamma procedure," 
which are the analogues of the "minimax backing-up procedure"
and the "alpha-beta procedure," respectively.

detection of three-dimensional patterns of atoms in chemical structures

an algorithm for detecting occurrences of a three-dimensional pattern of
objects within a larger structure is presented.  the search technique
presented uses the geometric structure of the pattern to define
characteristics demanded of candidates for matching. this is useful
in cases where the properties of each atom, considered individually,
do not adequately limit the number of sets of possible matchings.
several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry
are: (1) in pharmacology: searching for a common constellation
of atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities;
(2) in x-ray crystallography: fitting a structure or a structural fragment
to a set of peaks in the electron-density distribution of
a fourier map; (3) in chemical documentation; retrieving from
a file the structures containing specified substructures.

techniqueshe dec-338 serves as an input 
terminal for movie making, allowing the trial and error
design of picture sequences in a conversational

(light pen, pushbuttons, and teletype) is maintained. 
 at the user's request, this record is sent to the ibm
360/75 where the s-d 4020 instructions necessary 
to produce the same sequence of pictures can be generated.
 it is anticipated that one of the primary 
contributions of animator will be the provision of a
facility which will allow any professor to produce

language analysis in the humanities

the use of the computer in the language-oriented

************************
 in the language-oriented
humanities for exhaustive listing of detail 
(as in indices and concordances) is widespread and accepted
as desirable.  the implications of the computer 
for a "science" of the humanities-a science entailing
gathering data for the construction and testing 
of models-are neither widely recognized nor accepted.
 this paper argues that the computer's  major role 
as to language analysis in the humanities will be the
establishing of such a sciencehus, for those 
areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision
are necessary (e.g. analyzing literature or teaching 
a student to write a composition) the computer
can be a critically important facilitator.

the cyclic order property of vertices as an aid in scene analysis

a cyclic-order property is defined for bodies bounded by smooth-curved faces.
the property is shown to be useful for analyzing pictures of such bodies,
particularly when the line data extracted from the pictures are imperfect.
this property augments previously known grammatical rules that
determine the existence of three-dimensional bodies corresponding
to given two-dimensional line-structure data.

global optimization by suppression of partial redundancies

the elimination of redundant computations and the moving of invariant
computations out of loops are often done separately, with invariants 
moved outward loop by loop.  we propose to do both at once and
to move each expression directly to the entrance of the outermost
loop in which it is invariant.  this is done by solving a more
general problem, i.e. the elimination of computations performed
twice on a given execution path.  such computations are termed partially
redundant.  moreover, the algorithm does not require any graphical
information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph.
testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly
linear with the size of the program, and that it leads
to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time.

person-matching by electronic methods

record linkage in the updating of files is
accomplished in many establishments through the 
use of a preassigned number, such as payroll number,
customer number, or social security number.  in 
vital and health records, however, a unique number
is generally not preassigned to an individual for 
purposes of reporting services received to the health
department.  in order to determine whether different 
physician reports refer to the same individual, name
and other identification must be compared.  this 
is a laborious operation which is subject to various
errors because of name misspellings, changes of 
name upon marriage, and other problems.  we are interested
in the maintenance of a psychiatric case register 
in maryland, where many of the reports from over a hundred
psychiatric agencies refer to the same patient. 
 these records must be linked in order to provide unduplicated
counts of individuals under care and longitudinal 
records of psychiatric history.  an earlier paper [1] describes
our general procedures for register maintenance 
by use of a digital computer (honeywell 800).  here

a program for the syntactic analysis of english sentences

a program is described which produces syntactic
analyses of english sentences with respect 
to a transformational grammar.  the main features of the
analyzer are that it uses only a limited dictionary 
of english words and that it pursues all analysis paths
simultaneously while processing the sentence 
from left to right.  the form of representation used
for the dictionary and the grammar is indicated 
and an outline account is given of the analysis procedure.
 techniques for keeping the size of the analysis 
record within reasonable limits and for avoiding the need
for dynamic application of certain transformational 
rules are described.   a number of examples of output
produced by the program are given.  the output 
includes timing information.

machine controls for analysis of variance

a major problem in using the analysis of variance,
as the number of factors increases, is the 
exponential rise in the number of interactions.  even
though the experimenter may not be interested in 
these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in
most experimental designs because of the problem 
of getting error terms.  it is natural therefore to look

the multistore parser for hierarchical syntactic structures

a syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patterns
that are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings.  particular
emphasis is given to the system of "significant addresses" by means
of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures
can be substantially reduced.  the description makes frequent use
of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the
parser in an experimental english sentence analyzer.  by structuring
an area of the computer's central core storage 
************************
's central core storage in such a way
that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the
data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information
is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated
altogether.  the matches are traced by means of binary masks
and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the
procedure.  the method could be implemented with any interpretive
grammar, provided it can be expressed by the functional classification
of the items composing the input hierarchical structures.

pattern width at a given angle

that the pattern feature "width as a function
of angle" possesses several possible interpretations 
is demonstrated in this paper, which is a review of
the width concept in pattern recognition and the 
geometrical concept itself.  the object of the work
is to clarify how the word description can be made 
precise so that computer algorithms for feature 
************************
 algorithms for feature extraction
may be obtained; the focus is on the theoretical 
subject matter.  the results consist of a set-theoretic
definition of width-at-angle, a theorem relating 
it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions
of alternate widths.  all widths are calculated 
for an illustrative example; graphical and tabular comparisons
are given.  substantial variation in width-at-angle 
magnitude is found.  the principal conclusion is that
the set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern 
feature when it can be easily computed.  further investigation
of the information contained in only part 
of a width function is recommended for cases where
computation of width-at-angle is difficult.
