organizing matrices and matrix operations for paged memory systems matrix representations and operations are examined for the purpose of minimizing the page faulting occurring in a paged memory system it is shown that carefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to enormous savings in the number of page faults occurring when only a small part of the total matrix can be in main memory at one time examination of addition multiplication and inversion algorithms shows that a partitioned matrix representation i e one submatrix or partition per page in most cases induced fewer page faults than a row by row representation the number of page pulls required by these matrix manipulation algorithms is also studied as a function of the number of pages of main memory available to the algorithm cacm march 1969 mckellar a c coffman jr e g matrix algorithms array processing paging algorithms paged memory systems virtual memory systems array storage allocation storage allocation 4 12 4 39 5 14 ca690303 jb february 20 1978 9 35 am 1892 4 1924 1924 4 1924 2095 4 1924 2218 4 1924 2297 4 1924 2374 4 1924 2526 4 1924 2667 4 1924 2668 4 1924 2862 4 1924 2863 4 1924 1728 5 1924 1924 5 1924 1924 5 1924 1924 5 1924 2365 5 1924 2582 5 1924 3152 5 1924 987 6 1924 1751 6 1924 1754 6 1924 1924 6 1924 1924 6 1924 1924 6 1924 2017 6 1924 2130 6 1924 2362 6 1924 2365 6 1924
