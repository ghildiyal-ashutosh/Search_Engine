generating beta variates with nonintegrel shape parameters a new rejection method is described for generating beta variates the method is compared with previously published methods both theoretically and through computer timings it is suggested that the method has advantages in both speed and programming simplicity over previous methods especially for difficult combinations of parameter values cacm april 1978 cheng r beta variates random numbers simulation 5 5 8 1 ca780409 dh february 26 1979 3 32 pm 2847 4 3107 2928 4 3107 3046 4 3107 3098 4 3107 3107 4 3107 2569 5 3107 3107 5 3107 3107 5 3107 3107 5 3107
