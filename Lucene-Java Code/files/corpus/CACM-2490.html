efficient algorithms for graph manipulation h algorithm a447 efficient algorithms are presented for partitioning a graph into connected components biconnected components and simple paths the algorithm for partitioning of a graph into simple paths is iterative and each iteration produces a new path between two vertices already on paths the start vertex can be specified dynamically if v is the number of vertices and e is the number of edges each algorithm requires time and space proportional to max v e when executed on a random access computer cacm june 1973 hopcroft j tarjan r graphs analysis of algorithms graph manipulation 5 32 ca730610 jb january 23 1978 1 55 pm 2490 4 2490 2177 5 2490 2490 5 2490 2490 5 2490 2490 5 2490
