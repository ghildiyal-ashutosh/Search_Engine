on the probability distribution of the values of binary trees

an integral equation is derived for the generating
function for binary tree values, the values 
reflecting sorting effort. the analysis does not assume
uniformly distributed branching ratios, and 
therefore is applicable to a family of sorting algorithms
discussed by hoare, singleton, and van emden. 
 the solution to the integral equation indicates that
using more advanced algorithms in the family makes 
only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort,
but substantially reduces the variance in sorting 
effort.  statistical tests of the values of several

experiments in automatic learning for a multipurpose heuristic program

an automatic learning capability has been developed
and implemented for use with the multiple 
(multipurpose program that learns) heuristic tree-searching
program, which is presently being applied 
to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus.
multiple's proving program (pp) uses two evaluation 
functions to guide its search for a proof of whether
or not a particular goal is achievable.  thirteen 
general features of predicate calculus clauses were created
for use in the automatic learning of better 
evaluation functions for pp.  a multiple regression
program was used to produce optimal coefficients 
for linear polynomial functions

 also, automatic data-handling routines were 
written for passing data between the learning program
and the proving program, and for analyzing and 
summarizing results.  data was generally collected for
learning (regression analysis) from the experience 
of pp.  a number of experiments were performed to test

improvements in the solutions to problems

for data collection.  another experiment demonstrated 
that the learning program could simultaneously improve
performance on problems in a specific domain and 
on problems in a variety of domains.  some variations

a statistical model for console behavior in multiuser computers

the ability of a computer system to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
it is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 no claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  using the model we answer questions like: 
how many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  what is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  what bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system 
design.

network are constructed, one to find 
the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate
the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained

adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  the form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  the modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  simulation results are presented

scheduling independent tasks to reduce mean finishing time

sequencing to minimize mean finishing time
(or mean time in system) is not only desirable to 
the user, but it also tends to minimize at each point
in time the storage required to hold incomplete 
tasks.  in this paper a deterministic model of independent
tasks is introduced and new results are derived 
which extend and generalize the algorithms known for
minimizing mean finishing time.  in addition to 
presenting and analyzing new algorithms it is shown
that the most general mean-finishing-time problem 
for independent tasks is polynomial complete, and hence unlikely
to admit of a non-enumerative solution

is a passive broadcast medium with no central 
control.  coordination of access to the ether for packet
broadcasts is distributed among the contending 
transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration.
 switching of packets to their destinations

a proposal to establish a pseudo virtual memory via writable overlays

many computer systems solve executable storage
size problems for large programs by using overlays. 
 however, it appears that no one overlay scheme contains
a well-balanced combination of the most useful 
capabilities which are found in various existing techniques.
 a proposal is presented which utilizes 
several of the best capabilities from existing schemes
and is complemented by several additional features,

provides a virtual memory effect, although the

the self-judgment method of curve fitting

a computer-oriented method for processing and
communicating numerical data is described.  the 
instrument reliability factors (irf), which exactly
define the limits of reliability of each measured 
item of information, are used to compute the maximum
permitted error (mpe) associated with each values 
of each ordinate.  the self-judgment principle (sjp)
is used to discard wrong information and to compute 
mean values of the parameters and their mpe's in terms
of the irf.  data compatibility tests with any

a statistical study of the accuracy of floating point number systems

this paper presents the statistical results
of tests of the accuracy of certain 
************************
 of the accuracy of certain arithmetic 
systems in evaluating sums, products and inner products,
and analytic error estimates for some of the 
computations.  the arithmetic systems studied are 6-digit
hexadecimal and 22-digit binary floating point 
number representations combined with the usual chop
and round modes of arithmetic with various numbers 
of guard digits, and with a modified round mode with guard
digits.  in a certain sense, arithmetic systems 
differing only in their use of binary or hexadecimal number
representations are shown to be approximately 
statistically equivalent inaccuracy.

achieving specific accuracy in simulation output analysis

this paper extends the use of the regenerative
property of queueing systems in the analysis 
of simulation output.  in particular, it describes a
sequential estimation method which when used with 
the regenerative property allows results to be obtained
with specified statistical accuracy.  this method 
includes a test to check the normality

the design and implementation of 
************************
 and implementation of a table driven,
interactive diagnostic programming system

caps is a highly interactive diagnostic compiler/interpreter
that allows beginning programmers 
to prepare, debug, and execute fairly simple programs
at a graphics display terminal.  complete syntax 
checking and most semantic analysis is performed as
the program is entered and as it is subsequently
edited.  analysis is performed character by character.
 the most remarkable feature of caps is its ability 
to automatically diagnose errors both at compile time
and at run time.  errors are not automatically 
corrected.  instead, caps interacts with the student to help
him find the cause of his error.  most components 
of caps are table driven,

polynomial and spline approximation by quadratic programming

the problem of approximation to a given function,
or of fitting a given set of data, where 
the approximating function is required to have certain
of its derivations of specified sign over the 
whole range of approximation, is studied.  two approaches
are presented, in each of which quadratic programming 
is used to provide both the constraints on the derivatives
and the selection of the function which yields 
the best fit.  the first is a modified bernstein polynomial
scheme, and the second is a spline fit.

sentence paraphrasing from a conceptual base

a model of natural language based on an underlying
language-free representation of meaning 
is described.  a program based on this model is able
to produce sentence paraphrases which demonstrate 
understanding with respect to a given context.  this
generator operates in conjunction with a natural 
language analyzer and a combined memory and inference model.
 in generating sentences from meaning structures, 
the program employs both the information retrieval and
deduction capabilities of the memory model.  the 
model encompasses several diverse classes of linguistic
knowledge, which include: (1) executable tests 
of conceptual properties

computing polynomial resultants: bezout's determinant
vs. collins' reduced p. algorithm

algorithms for computing the resultant of two
polynomials in several variables, a key repetitive 
step of computation in solving systems of polynomial
equations by elimination, are studied.  determining 
the best algorithm for computer implementation depends
upon the extent to which extraneous factors are 
introduced, the extent of propagation of errors caused by
truncation of real coefficients, memory requirements, 
and computing speed.  preliminary considerations narrow
the choice of the best algorithm to bezout's 
determinant and collins' reduced polynomial remainder sequence
(p.r.s.) algorithm.  detailed tests performed 
on sample 
************************
 performed 
on sample problems conclusively show that bezout's determinant
is superior in all respects except for 
univariate polynomials, in which case collins' reduced
p.r.s. algorithm is somewhat faster.  in particular 
bezout's determinant proves to be strikingly superior in
numerical accuracy, displaying excellent stability 
with regard to round-off errors. results of tests are reported in detail.

theoretical considerations in information retrieval systems

information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
************************
: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  for identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by goffman, verhoeff and belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  for searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant

for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  the inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.

a mathematical programming updating method using modified
givens transformations and applied to lp problems

an efficient and numerically stable method is presented for the problem of
updating an orthogonal decomposition of a matrix of column (or row) vectors.
the fundamental idea is to add a column (or row) analogous
to adding an additional row of data in a linear least squares problem.
a column (or

 problem.
a column (or row) is dropped by a formal scaling with the
imaginary unit,  -1, followed by least squares addition of the column
(or row).  the elimination process for the procedure is successive
ssive application of the givens transformation in modified (more efficient)
form.  these ideas are illustrated with an implementation
of the revised simplex method.  the algorithm is a general purpose
one that does not account for any particular structure or sparsity
in the equations.  some suggested computational tests for determining
signs of various controlling

automation of etching-pattern layout

help (heuristic etching-pattern layout program)
is an application program developed to computerize 
the tedious and error-prone although vitally important
wiring design of printed circuit boards.  help 
helps automate a design stage one step closer to production
than logical design.  it can be used to design 
wiring patterns of two-layer circuit boards on which
ics in dual-in-line packages as well as discrete 
components such as transistors 
************************
 such as transistors and resistors have been
placed.  help employs two methods of wiring.  
one is the heuristic method, which simulates human
approaches to wiring design, and the other is the

, and the other is the 
theoretically interesting but time-consuming method of
maze-running, based on the lee's algorithm.  help 
performs more than 90 percent of required wiring by
the heuristic path with respect to a performance 
function for each point-to-point, and point-to-line
connection.  it can bring the number of successful 
wiring connections very close to 100 percent.

extensively in recent years that the whole concept 
for organizing a computer code has undergone a radical
change.  it no longer is adequate merely to reduce

such a variety of situations that the respective computer
subprograms must be organized into an integrated 
system.  emphasis in this paper is devoted to the underlying
principles upon which future linear programming 
systems must be based.  these viewpoints are influenced
by the new demands that applications within the 
petroleum industry are placing on such systems.  some
