texture and reflection in computer generated images

in 1974 catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. 
 this paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
 the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  the intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. the shape
and size of this weighting

expanding the editing function in language data processing

in automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  applications are described,
such processes as factor analysis.  applications 
are described, such as the quick, unbiased evaluation
of a large volume of incoming mail or telegrams, 
yielding summary reports not possible for either
humans or computers to produce alone.

an application of heuristic search methods to edge and contour detection

this paper presents a method for detecting edges
and contours in noisy pictures.  the properties 
of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge
detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing 
the given figure of merit.  this problem can be represented
as a shortest path problem on a graph and 
can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms.
 the relations between this representation of 
the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach
are discussed, showing that the graph search 
method can lead to substantial improvements in computing
time.  moreover, if heuristic search methods 
are used, the computing time will depend on the amount
of noise in the picture.  some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the separation 
of touching objects.

a vector space model for automatic indexing

in a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  an approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model.

application of game tree searching techniques
to sequential pattern recognition

a sequential pattern recognition (spr) procedure
does not test all the features of a pattern 
at once.  instead, it selects a feature to be tested.  after
receiving the result of that test, the procedure 
either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another
feature to be tested, etc.  medical diagnosis 
is an example of spr.  in this paper the authors suggest
that spr be viewed as a one-person game played 
against nature (chance).  virtually all the powerful techniques
developed for searching two-person, strictly 
competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either
directly or by analogy into spr procedures. 
 in particular, one can incorporate the "mini average
backing-up procedure" and the "gamma procedure," 
which are the analogues of the "minimax backing-up procedure"
and the "alpha-beta procedure," respectively.

 determining such a surface is reduced to the problem
of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed

cycles is utilized.  also developed is a closed-form 
expression, in term of the number of contour poin ts, for
an upper bound on the number of operations required

a simply extended and modified batch
environment graphical system (sembegs)

sembegs is a complete batch environment graphical
system containing components for handling 
graphical data files, for displaying the contents of
these files on a variety of graphical hardware, 
and for performing graphical batch input operations.
 sembegs is easy to extend and modify to meet the 
growing needs of a large batch environment, and is even
extendable to a fully interactive system.  the 
paper presents the conceptual view of graphics leading
to the design of sembegs and outlines the major 
components of the system.  the design of sembegs is founded
upon the basic assumption that the true aim 
of computer graphics is to describe graphical entities,
rather than, as commonly held, to provide graphical 
input and output functional capabilities.  sembegs

computers and electronic data 
************************
s and electronic data processing are
a major technological innovation in the operations 
of american local government. this paper establishes that
there is substantial variation among the larger 
local governments in the rate at which they adopt computer
technology, in the level of financial support 
they provide for edp, and in the extensiveness and sophistication
of their automated applications.  the 
central question addressed is: what might explain the
differences between governments in the extent to 
which they adopt and use computers?  hypotheses are
tested 
************************
?  hypotheses are
tested for several streams of explanatory factors, 
using data from more than 500 city and county governments.
 the findings identify certain local government 
milieus which are particularly conducive to higher levels
of computer innovation.  somewhat unexpected 
findings reveal the significant impact of the distribution
of control over edp decisions and the dominant 
political values within the government. other important
factors include the measured need for computer 
applications and the presence of external funding support
for computing.  finally, the paper suggests 
a framework for identifying the key determinants
of other technological innovations.

the algorithm presented causes the elimination of
hidden lines in the representation of a perspective 
view of concave and convex plane-faced objects on the
picture plane.  all the edges of the objects are 
considered sequentially, and all planes which hide every
point of an edge are found.  the computing time 
increases roughly as the square of the number of edges.
 the algorithm takes advantage of a reduced number 
of concave points and automatically recognizes if only
one object with no concave points is considered. 
in this last case, the result is obtained in a much simpler way.

reconstruction of pictures from their projections

there are situations in the natural sciences
and medicine (e.g. in electron microscopy and 
x-ray photography) in which it is desirable to estimate the
gray levels of a digital picture at the individual 
points from the sums of the gray levels along straight
lines (projections) at a few angles.  usually, 
in such situations, the picture is far from determined
and the problem is to find the "most representative" 
picture.  three algorithms are described (all using
monte carlo methods) which were designed to solve 
this problem.  the algorithms are applicable in a large
and varied number of fields.  the most important 
uses may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particles
from electron micrographs and three-dimensional 
x-ray analysis.

cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems

a cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.  the chief computational advantage 
offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed
achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel 
processing.  in this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  for example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  a major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  in particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, pert chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 these algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

global optimization by suppression of partial redundancies

the elimination of redundant computations and the moving of invariant
computations out of loops are often done separately, with invariants 
moved outward loop by loop.  we propose to do both at once and
to move each expression directly to the entrance of the outermost
loop in which it is invariant.  this is done by solving a more
general problem, i.e. the elimination of computations performed
twice on a given execution path.  such computations are termed partially
redundant.  moreover, the algorithm does not require any graphical
information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph.
testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly
linear with the size of the program, and that it leads
to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time.

several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry
are: (1) in pharmacology: searching for a common constellation
of atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities;
