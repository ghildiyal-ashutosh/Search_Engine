internal and tape sorting using the replacement selection technique a general technique for sequencing unsorted records is presented the technique is shown to be applicable for the first stage of a generalized sort program the formation of initial strings as well as for sorting records within a memory storage an internal sort it is shown that given n records in memory storage records are sequenced using 1 log2 n tests per record that initial string lengths will average 2n for random input records and that reading writing and processing can be accomplished simultaneously if the computer permits such overlap cacm may 1963 goetz m a ca630502 jb march 14 1978 11 36 am 1919 4 865 852 4 865 864 4 865 865 4 865 2017 5 865 74 5 865 851 5 865 865 5 865 865 5 865 865 5 865 849 6 865 850 6 865 851 6 865 852 6 865 853 6 865 854 6 865 855 6 865 856 6 865 857 6 865 858 6 865 858 6 865 859 6 865 860 6 865 861 6 865 862 6 865 863 6 865 864 6 865 865 6 865 865 6 865 866 6 865
