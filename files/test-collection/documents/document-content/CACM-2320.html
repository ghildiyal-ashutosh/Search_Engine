structured multiprogramming this paper presents a proposal for structured representation of multiprogramming in a high level language the notation used explicitly associates a data structure shared by concurrent processes with operations defined on it this clarifies the meaning of programs and permits a large class of time dependent errors to be caught at compile time a combination of critical regions and event variables enables the programmer to control scheduling of resources among competing processes to any degree desired these concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only within operating systems but also within user programs cacm july 1972 hansen p b structured multiprogramming programming languages operating systems concurrent processes shared data mutual exclusion critical regions process communication synchronizing events 4 2 4 3 ca720708 jb january 30 1978 2 39 pm 2319 4 2320 2378 4 2320 2320 4 2320 2320 4 2320 2597 4 2320 2632 4 2320 2738 4 2320 2740 4 2320 2777 4 2320 2851 4 2320 2868 4 2320 2895 4 2320 2912 4 2320 2946 4 2320 3127 4 2320 3128 4 2320 2080 5 2320 2150 5 2320 2320 5 2320 2320 5 2320 2320 5 2320 2597 5 2320 2150 6 2320 2320 6 2320
