certification of programs for secure information flow this paper presents a certification mechanism for verifying the secure flow of information through a program because it exploits the properties of a lattice structure among security classes the procedure is sufficiently simple that it can easily be included in the analysis phase of most existing compilers appropriate semantics are presented and proved correct an important application is the confinement problem the mechanism can prove that a program can not cause supposedly nonconfidential results to depend on confidential input data cacm july 1977 denning d e denning p j protection security information flow program certification lattice confinement security classes 4 3 4 35 5 24 ca770707 jb december 28 1977 8 48 am 1807 4 2945 2034 4 2945 2290 4 2945 2579 4 2945 2923 4 2945 2945 4 2945 2945 4 2945 2945 4 2945 3128 4 2945 3150 4 2945 1947 5 2945 2704 5 2945 2870 5 2945 2945 5 2945 2945 5 2945 2945 5 2945
