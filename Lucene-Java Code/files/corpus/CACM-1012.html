formal parsing systems automatic syntactic analysis has recently become important for both natural language data processing and syntax directed compilers a formal parsing system g v u t r consists of two finite disjoint vocabularies v and t a many many map u from v onto t and a recursive set r of strings in t called syntactic sentence classes every program for automatic syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing system a directed production analyzer i t x p is a nondeterministic pushdown store machine with internal vocabulary i input vocabulary t and all productions of p in the form z a ay1 ym where z yi are elements of the set i and a is an element of the set t every context free language can be analyzed by a directed production analyzer the kuno oettinger multiple path syntactic analyzer for english is a concrete example of a directed production analyzer and of a working parsing algorithm the connection between structures assigned by the analyzer and those of a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined in this paper cacm august 1964 greibach s a ca640818 jb march 9 1978 6 30 pm 1012 5 1012 1012 5 1012 1012 5 1012 1225 5 1012 1350 5 1012 1945 5 1012 823 6 1012 914 6 1012 915 6 1012 917 6 1012 984 6 1012 989 6 1012 990 6 1012 1012 6 1012 1012 6 1012 1012 6 1012 1084 6 1012 1098 6 1012 1122 6 1012 1138 6 1012 1139 6 1012 1141 6 1012 1200 6 1012 1223 6 1012 1225 6 1012 1265 6 1012 1265 6 1012 1336 6 1012 1396 6 1012 1399 6 1012 1455 6 1012 1477 6 1012 1487 6 1012 1491 6 1012 1496 6 1012 483 6 1012 584 6 1012 669 6 1012 680 6 1012 680 6 1012 680 6 1012 763 6 1012
