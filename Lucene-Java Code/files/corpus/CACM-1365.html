eliminating monotonous mathematics with formac the formac formula manipulation compiler programming system provides a powerful tool for performing mathematical analysis it is an extension of fortran iv which permits the use of the computer to perform the tedious algebraic computations that arise in many different fields among the areas in which it has been successfully used are differentiation of complicated expressions expansion of truncated power series solution of simultaneous equations with literal coefficients nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation tensor analysis and generation of the coefficients of equations in keplerian motion these types of analysis which arose in the solution of specific practical problems in physics engineering astronomy statistics and astronautics are discussed in the paper in addition to its usage for specific problem solutions formac can also be used to automate the analysis phase in certain production programming several such applications are presented cacm october 1966 tobey r g ca661002 jb march 2 1978 4 14 pm 1396 5 1365 1365 5 1365 1365 5 1365 1365 5 1365 2229 5 1365 964 6 1365 1028 6 1365 1029 6 1365 1083 6 1365 1132 6 1365 1214 6 1365 1278 6 1365 1334 6 1365 1365 6 1365 1365 6 1365 1386 6 1365 1387 6 1365 1388 6 1365 1392 6 1365 1393 6 1365 1394 6 1365 1395 6 1365 1396 6 1365 1397 6 1365 1496 6 1365 284 6 1365 407 6 1365 3199 6 1365 3200 6 1365 3201 6 1365 3202 6 1365 3203 6 1365 3204 6 1365 561 6 1365 730 6 1365
