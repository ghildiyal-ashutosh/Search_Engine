solution of systems of polynomial equations by elimination the elimination procedure as described by williams has been coded in lisp and formac and used in solving systems of polynomial equations it is found that the method is very effective in the case of small systems where it yields all solutions without the need for initial estimates the method by itself appears in appropriate however in the solution of large systems of equation due to the explosive growth in the intermediate equations and the hazards which arise when the coefficients are truncated a comparison is made with difficulties found in other problems in non numerical mathematics such as symbolic integration and simplification cacm august 1966 moses j ca660811 jb march 2 1978 7 11 pm 1396 5 1387 1387 5 1387 1387 5 1387 1387 5 1387 1946 5 1387 878 6 1387 902 6 1387 964 6 1387 1028 6 1387 1029 6 1387 1083 6 1387 1093 6 1387 1132 6 1387 1177 6 1387 1214 6 1387 1278 6 1387 1334 6 1387 1365 6 1387 1386 6 1387 1387 6 1387 1387 6 1387 1388 6 1387 1392 6 1387 1393 6 1387 1393 6 1387 1394 6 1387 1395 6 1387 1396 6 1387 1397 6 1387 1496 6 1387 284 6 1387 360 6 1387 407 6 1387 3199 6 1387 3200 6 1387 3201 6 1387 3202 6 1387 3203 6 1387 3204 6 1387 561 6 1387 730 6 1387 731 6 1387
