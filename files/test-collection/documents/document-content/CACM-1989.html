transition network grammars for natural language analysis the use of augmented transition network grammars for the analysis of natural language sentences is described structure building actions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering restructuring and copying of constituents necessary to produce deep structure representations of the type normally obtained from a transformational analysis and conditions on the arcs allow for a powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take advantage of semantic information to guide the parsing the advantage of this model for natural language analysis are discussed in detail and illustrated by examples an implementation of an experimental parsing system for transition network grammars is briefly described cacm october 1970 woods w a computational linguistics grammars grammar models linguistics natural language analysis parsing semantic interpretation transition network grammars transformational grammars 3 42 4 12 ca701001 jb february 10 1978 9 43 am 1323 4 1989 1358 4 1989 1380 4 1989 1665 4 1989 1781 4 1989 1787 4 1989 1989 4 1989 1989 4 1989 2060 4 1989 2112 4 1989 2179 4 1989 2534 4 1989 2541 4 1989 2698 4 1989 2698 4 1989 2733 4 1989 2820 4 1989 2921 4 1989 3073 4 1989 3155 4 1989 3154 4 1989 1989 5 1989 1989 5 1989 1989 5 1989 2110 5 1989 2581 5 1989 2739 5 1989 2795 5 1989 2921 5 1989 3087 5 1989 799 5 1989 1928 6 1989 1989 6 1989 1989 6 1989 1989 6 1989 1989 6 1989 1989 6 1989 2046 6 1989 2110 6 1989 2274 6 1989
