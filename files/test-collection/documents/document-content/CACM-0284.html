manipulation of algebraic expressions an algorithm for algebraically manipulating expressions of the form sum cipi i 1 n has been developed in conjunction with the development of programs for systems analysis problems this algorithm enablesus to derive over all system transfer functions from algebraically described block diagrams of any linear continuous multi loop feedback system the machine representation of the derived expression is by virtue of the algorithm in a form which simplifies the task of compiling the algorithm was developed for a particular purpose in connection with system analysis studies however its application as a mathematical device extends far beyond the confines of the original problem cacm september 1961 rom a r m ca610910 jb march 16 1978 9 36 pm 964 5 284 1396 5 284 284 5 284 284 5 284 284 5 284 964 6 284 1028 6 284 1029 6 284 1083 6 284 1132 6 284 1214 6 284 1278 6 284 1334 6 284 1365 6 284 1386 6 284 1387 6 284 1388 6 284 1392 6 284 1393 6 284 1394 6 284 1395 6 284 1396 6 284 1397 6 284 1496 6 284 284 6 284 284 6 284 407 6 284 3199 6 284 3200 6 284 3201 6 284 3202 6 284 3203 6 284 3204 6 284 561 6 284 561 6 284 730 6 284 759 6 284
