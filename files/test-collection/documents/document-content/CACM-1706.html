champ character manipulation procedures a new programming language facility for symbol manipulation is described string procedures may be declared and called in a standard algol context algol procedures can in turn be called by string procedures so that numeric and symbolic processes may conveniently be programmed together concatenation and a variant of snobol s pattern matching make up a set of primitive commands these are assembled together into conditional expressions which are to be used to provide alternative computational patterns arrays of strings are processed using quantifiers the class of things which may be assigned to an identifier can be restricted by a procedure expressed in the notation the language facilities have been implemented in the algol compiler for the burroughs b5500 cacm august 1968 storm e f symbol manipulation string handling character manipulation conditional expressions procedures structure matching recursive programming quantifiers 4 22 4 13 ca680808 jb february 22 1978 10 39 am 1024 4 1706 1051 4 1706 1102 4 1706 1132 4 1706 1390 4 1706 1395 4 1706 1486 4 1706 1549 4 1706 1706 4 1706 1706 4 1706 1826 4 1706 1878 4 1706 378 4 1706 2060 4 1706 2155 4 1706 2168 4 1706 2719 4 1706 2723 4 1706 2838 4 1706 2842 4 1706 2855 4 1706 2879 4 1706 3077 4 1706 3080 4 1706 3106 4 1706 627 4 1706 106 4 1706 1180 5 1706 210 5 1706 1706 5 1706 1706 5 1706 1706 5 1706
