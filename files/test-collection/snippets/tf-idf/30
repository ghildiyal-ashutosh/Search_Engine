texture and reflection in computer generated images

in 1974 catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. 
 this paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
 the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  the intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. the shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  the patch rendering

 theory.  the patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 the amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  several examples of images synthesized

expanding the editing function in language data processing

in automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  applications are described,

development of each algorithm is the same.  pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.  it is found that the algorithm operating
with the triangular array is the most sensitive

automatic parsing for content analysis

although automatic syntactic and semantic analysis is not yet possible for
all of an unrestricted natural language text, some applications, of which 
content analysis is one, do not have such a stringent coverage requirement.
preliminary studies show that the harvard syntactic analyzer can
produce correct and unambiguous identification of the subject and
object of certain verbs for approximately half of the relevant occurrences. 
this provides a degree of coverage for content analysis variables which 
compares favorably to manual methods, in variables which compares favorably 
to manual methods, in which only a sample of the total available text is

a scan conversion algorithm with reduced storage requirements

most graphics systems using a raster scan output
device (crt or hardcopy) maintain a display 
file in the xy or random scan format.  scan converters,
hardware or software, must be provided to translate 
the picture description from the xy format to the raster
format.  published scan conversion algorithms 
which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enough
to accommodate the entire screen.  on the other 
hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because
they require multiple passes through the xy 
display file.  the scan conversion algorithm described
here uses a linked list data structure to process 
the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to
groups of scan lines.  a relatively small primary 
memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image
for a group of scan lines.  when this portion 
of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for
the next portion.  because of the list processing 
procedures used, only

brad: the brookhaven raster display

a multiconsole computer display system has
been designed that provides very rich displays at 
low unit cost.  each brad (brookhaven raster display)
console can plot tens of thousands of points, or 
up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second.  after
an initial display system investment of $50,000 
each display, with teletype, costs less than $3,000.
 the technique employed is that of programmatically 
generating a binary image of the desired display in a
computer.  the image is written on a rotating drum 
memory.  independent read heads continuously display
the picture, which is generated by swept horizontal 
lines.  a standard tv monitor serves as the display device.
 the technique has two drawbacks.  a computer 
must compute any image to be displayed.  also, the "pointing"
interaction is more difficult.  this is 
because the pointing function gives only the coordinates
of the point on the screen.  the inverse of 
the map generation process is required to calculate
the coordinates of the point on the screen.  the 
inverse of the map generation process is required to
calculate the coordinates at the selected point 
in the input space.

the reconstruction of binary patterns from their projections

given the horizontal and vertical projections
of a finite binary pattern f, can we construct 
the original pattern f?  in this paper we give a characterization
of patterns that are reconstructable 
from their projection.  three algorithms are developed
to reconstruct both unambiguous and ambiguous 
patterns.  it is shown that an unambiguous pattern can
be perfectly reconstructed in time m x n and that 
a pattern similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructed
in time m x n, where m, n are the dimensions 
of the pattern frame.

using synthetic images to register real images with surface models

 terrain models.  in addition,
automatic classification of terrain, using

with the effects of varying sun angle and

we achieve the required alignment by matching the real
image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface 
model and known positions of the light sources.  the
synthetic image intensity is calculated using the 
reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection
as a function of surface gradient. 
 we illustrate the technique using landsat images and digital terrain models.

relaxation methods for image reconstruction

the problem of recovering an image (a function
of two variables) from experimentally available 
integrals of its grayness over thin strips is of great
importance in a large number of scientific areas. 
 an important version of the problem in medicine is
that of obtaining the exact density distribution 
within the human body from x-ray projectionsne approach
that has been taken to solve this problem 
consists of translating the available information into
a system of linear inequalities.  the size and 
the sparsity of the resulting system (typically, 25,000
inequalities with fewer than 1 percent of the 
coefficients nonzero) makes methods using successive
relaxations computationally attractive, as compared 
to other ways of solving systems of inequalities. 
in this paper, it is shown that, for a consistent 
system of linear inequalities, any sequence of relaxarion parameters
lying strictly between 0 and 2 generates 
a sequence of vectors which converges to a solution.
 under the same assumptions, for a system of linear 
equations, the relaxation method converges to the minimum
norm solution.  previously proposed techniques
are shown to be special cases of our procedure with
different choices of relaxation parameters.  the 
practical consequences for image reconstruction of the
choice of the relaxation parameters are discussed.

 it also has many applications in numerical

algorithms are fairly complicated and require 
considerable storage space.  a simple extension has
been found to the conventional orthogonalization 
method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives

= n.  in the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary
inverse of a.  in the second case the algorithm 
yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix

 in addition, the study demonstrates the usefulness of

reconstruction of pictures from their projections

there are situations in the natural sciences
and medicine (e.g. in electron microscopy and 
x-ray photography) in which it is desirable to estimate the
gray levels of a digital picture at the individual 
points from the sums of the gray levels along straight
lines (projections) at a few angles.  usually, 
in such situations, the picture is far from determined
and the problem is to find the "most representative" 
picture.  three algorithms are described (all using
monte carlo methods) which were designed to solve 
this problem.  the algorithms are applicable in a large
and varied number of fields.  the most important 
uses may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particles

integral equations of immunology

the inversion of a particular integral equation
of the first (fredholm) kind is the basic problem 
considered.  the strategy which yielded success consisted
of three essential points: (1) fit the known 
experimental data by a curve with properties which derive
from properties of the (as yet unknown) function; 
(2) stabilize the computation for the unknown function
by using singular value decomposition; (3) constrain

a card format for reference files in information processing

this paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  an 80-column ibm card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  the format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  the reference
material includes basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
the identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source of the reference.  the 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms,

some new methods of detecting step edges in digital pictures

this note describes two operators that respond
to step edges, but not to ramps.  the first 
is similar to the digital laplacian, but uses the max, rather
than the sum, of the x and y second differences. 
 the second uses the difference between the mean and
median gray levels in a neighborhood.  the outputs 
obtained from these operators applied to a set of test
pictures are compared with each other and with 
the standard digital laplacian and gradient.  a third
operator, which uses the distance between the center 
and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value, is also
briefly considered; it turns out to be equivalent 
to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient.

implications of the digital computer
for education in the mathematical sciences

the digital 
************************
 sciences

the digital computer has profoundly altered the
definition of what is interesting in mathematics. 
 the importance of applied logic in human affairs is
changed by the existence of the "logical engine." 
 the result is that one should no longer think in terms
of a single discipline of mathematics but in 
terms of a complex of mathematical sciences.

computer formulation of the equations of motion using tensor notation

a means is described for extending the area
of application of digital computers beyond the 
numerical data processing stage and reducing the 
************************
 stage and reducing the need for
human participation in the formulation of certain 
types of computer problems.  by the use of tensor calculus
and a computer language designed to facilitate 
symbolic mathematical computation, a method has been
devised whereby a digital computer can be used 
************************
 computer can be used to 
do non-numeric work, that is, symbolic algebraic manipulation
and differentiation. to illustrate the 
techniques involved, a digital computer has been used
to derive the equations of motion of a point mass 
in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system.
 since this operation involves a formulation in 
terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients,
it provides a good demonstration of a computer's 
capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the
formulation process which normally precedes the 
numerical data processing stage.  moreover, this particular
problem serves to illustrate the advantages 
of the mathematical techniques employed.
