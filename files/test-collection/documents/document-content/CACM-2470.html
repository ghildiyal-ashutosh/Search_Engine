fen an axiomatic basis for program semantics a formal system is presented which abstracts the notions of data item function and relation it is argued that the system is more suitable than set theory or its derivatives for the concise and accurate description of program semantics it is shown how the system can be used to build composite data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing structuring and uniting it is also demonstrated that completely new primitive types can be introduced into languages through the mechanism of singleton data types both deterministic and nondeterministic functions are shown to be definable in the system it is described how the local environment can be modeled as a data item and how imperative statements can be considered functions on the environment the nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced into the system the technique is contrasted with the use of the paradoxical combinator y the questions of local and global environments and of various modes of function calling and parameter passing are touched upon the theory is applied to the proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics of the assignment conditional and iterative statements an appendix is included which presents in detail the formal system governing webs and fen the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper cacm august 1973 maclennan b j semantics formal systems lambda calculus extensible languages data types modes axioms correctness formal language definition formal description data structures description languages models of computation 4 22 5 21 5 24 5 26 ca730804 jb january 23 1978 11 01 am 1469 4 2470 1486 4 2470 1491 4 2470 1781 4 2470 2021 4 2470 2060 4 2470 2178 4 2470 2222 4 2470 2227 4 2470 2294 4 2470 2315 4 2470 2326 4 2470 2326 4 2470 2470 4 2470 2470 4 2470 2470 4 2470 2470 4 2470 2684 4 2470 2732 4 2470 2865 4 2470 2896 4 2470 2943 4 2470 3014 4 2470 3044 4 2470 3068 4 2470 3077 4 2470 3124 4 2470 3143 4 2470 1303 5 2470 1469 5 2470 1834 5 2470 2264 5 2470 2470 5 2470 2470 5 2470 2470 5 2470
