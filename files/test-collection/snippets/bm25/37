a statistical model for console behavior in multiuser computers

the ability of a computer system to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
it is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 no claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  using the model we answer questions like:

dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent

logic and programming languages

logic has been long in terested in whether answers
to certain questions are computable in principle, 
since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of
formalization.  more recently, precise comparisons 
in the efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 these, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  what is a machine?
 what is a computable process?  how (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 the definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 so far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  it would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  these levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 the experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial

orderings) under an information content ordering,

arguments for a moratorium on the construction
of a community information utility

in this article the author urges a prudent
and decentralized approach to the question of the 
design and desirability of computerized community information
utilities.  before accepting the inevitability 
and desirability of this or any technology, we should:
(1) be sure of the feasibility (internally and 
externally) of what is proposed; (2) project and perhaps
wait for changes in complementary techniques; 
(3) evaluate current and projected supplementary techniques;
(4) establish the existence of demand for 
what is proposed; (5) take steps to involve a representative
group of ultimate users in systems design, 
and (6) carefully think through possible side effects
on man and his world view.  current proposals for 
community information utilities are examined in this
framework, and the conclusion is drawn that society 
is not yet in a position to justify either the construction
of an information utility in a prototype 
community or the acceptance

a language extension for expressing constraints on data access

controlled sharing of information is needed and
desirable for many applications and is supported 
in operating systems by access control mechanisms.  this
paper shows how to extend programming languages 
to provide controlled sharing.  the extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 the constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 the approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.

improving locality by critical working sets

a new approach to program locality improvement
via restructuring is described.  the method 
is particularly suited to those systems where primary memory
is managed according to a working set strategy. 
 it is based on the concept of critical working set, a
working set which does not contain the next memory 
reference.  the data the method operates upon are extracted from
a trace of the program to be restructured. 
 it is shown that, except in some special cases, the
method is not optimum.  however, the experimental 
results obtained by using the method to restructure an
interactive text editor and the file system module 
of an operating system have shown its substantial superiority
over the other methods proposed in the 
literature.

most current programming languages treat computation
over different classes of objects (e.g.

activity of answering this question is usually called

in particular, a program is mapped into an expression 
within a decidable subset of the lambda calculus, which
characterizes the type relations within the program 
and eliminates all other information.  the determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".  an application 
to type checking in algol 60 is made, and the attendant
problems faced for any notion of type checking

signature simulation and certain cryptographic codes

three cyphers allegedly authored by thomas
jefferson beale in 1822 have been the subject of 
intensive study for over 100 years.  generations of
cryptanalysts have expended untold man-years, thus 
far without success, attempting tode code them; vast armies
of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have 
devoted herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills
of virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza. 
 the history of pertinent activities would fill volumes,
yet serious students of cryptography have always 
had nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity.
 it has been alleged that the "known solution" to 
cypher number two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49,...("i

four miles from buford's in an excavation or vault...")
with the aid of an unsanitized version of the 
declaration of independence was merely a superb, imaginative,
and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago 
for whatever reasons.  modern computer technology could
obviously perform signature analyses the process 
of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper
insights into their construction.  for the benefit 
of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the
second cypher employs a specified document whose 
words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters
of these words are sought out at random to 
match the letters of these words are sought out at random
to match the letters of the clear text or message. 
 the sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches
is then written down as the final code.  while 
primitive, the process has the advantage of relative
security until the source document becomes known; 
at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second
graders.  the work now completed with the help 
of our univac 1108 includes numerous analytical studies
of the beale cyphers and various types of simulations.

algorithmic selection of the best
method for compressing map data strings

the best of a dozen different methods for
compressing map data is illustrated.  the choices 
are generated by encoding data strings-sequence of like
codes-by three methods and in four directions. 
 relationships are developed between compression alternatives
to avoid comparing all of them.  the technique 
has been used to compress data from forest resource maps,
but is widely applicable to map and photographic

a fast and usually linear algorithm for global
flow analysis (abstract only--complete paper jacm 
23,1 january, 1976)

a new algorithm for global flow analysis on
reducible graphs is presented. the algorithm is 
shown to treat a very general class of function spaces.
 for a graph of e edges, the algorithm has a 
worst case time bound of o(e log e) function operations.
 it is also shown that in programming terms, 
the number of operations is proportional to e plus the
number of exits from program loops.  consequently 
a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structures

larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxing
the time bound.  examples are given of code 
improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm.

aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction
which is important in conceptualizing the real 
world.  aggregation transforms a relationship between
objects into a higher-level object.  a new data 
type, called aggregation, 
************************
, called aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies 
aggregation abstractions.  relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  to main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  it 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  a top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure

a case study of a new code generation technique for compilers

recent developments in optimizing techniques
have allowed a new design for compilers to emerge. 
 such a compiler translates the parsed source code into
lower level code by a sequence of steps.  each 
step expands higher level statements into blocks of
lower level code and then performs optimizations 
on the result.  each statement has only one possible
expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take 
advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations.
 this paper provides evidence that this 
strategy can indeed result in good object code.  the
traditionally difficult pl/i concatenate statement 
was investigated as a detailed example.  a set of fairly
simple optimizations was identified which allow 
the compiler to produce good code. more elaborate optimizations
can further improve the object code. 
 for most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code
produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization 
strategy described above compares favorably with the
code produced by a conventional pl/i optimizing 
compiler.

some legal implications of the use of computers in the banking business

the introduction of computers in to the banking
business has a wide variety of legal implications 
that merit careful attention at this very early stage.
 the industry is highly regulated by government 
and, hence, is subject to many statutes and regulations.
 it also is affected by important common law 
rules established by courts.  the legal ramifications
involve not only the mechanization itself, but 
also the very significant, economically attractive phenomenon
of off premises processing.  it is essential 
to identify and provide for many legal aspects right
now, before systems and practices crystallize, in 
order to avoid the later impact of unanticipated physical
complications and expense.  the legal aspects 
of computerization in the banking business are especially
diverse.  in some states, there might be the 
basic question whether banks are authorized by law to
invest in the new facilities, either directly or 
through cooperatives.  more challenging are questions
relating to off-premises processors, particularly 
with respect to the obligation not to disclose information
concerning a bank's customers, the adequacy 
of fidelity bond coverage, the extent of liability for
improper refusal to pay a check, and susceptibility

abstraction mechanisms in clu

clu is a new programming language designed to support
the use of abstractions in program construction. 
 work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 clu provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  this paper provides an in troduction
to the abstraction mechanisms in clu.  by 
means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction 
is illustrated, and it is shown how clu programs may
be written to use and implement abstractions.  the

a record and file partitioning model

one of the main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  this paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable
length data-items.  the probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
the file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  one of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  the model that is presented in

one; several types of file systems may

a major problem in using the analysis of variance,

though the experimenter may not be interested in 
these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in
most experimental designs because of the problem 
of getting error terms.  it is natural therefore to look

in computing the interactions.  a program device

the structure of programming languages

the following are identified as major components
of every programming language: (1) the elementary 
program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking elementary
statements together, (3) the means by which 
a program can obtain data inputs.  several alternative
forms of each of these components are described, 
compared and evaluated.  many examples, frequently from
list processing languages, illustrate the forms 
described.  elementary program statements usually take
the form of commands, requirements, or implicit 
specifications.  a command is an imperative statement
that commands the action to be taken.  a requirement 
describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything
about the actions to be taken.  an implicit 
specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer
must understand what actions will be taken 
to achieve the desired effect.  subroutines may be entered
explicitly, by execute call, or by function 
composition.  explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions.  an execute 
subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction of the programming language. 
 function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call.  the three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to
the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by 
a "name", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means
of variables or functions.  names are useful 
entry points into permanent data structures, but can
be error-causing distractions in other contexts.

a syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patterns

emphasis is given to the system of "significant addresses" by means
of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures
can be substantially reduced.  the description makes frequent use
of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the
parser in an experimental english sentence analyzer.  by structuring
an area of the computer's central core storage in such a way
that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the
data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information
is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated
altogether.  the matches are traced by means
