improved event scanning mechanisms for discrete event simulation simulation models of large complex real world applications have occasionally earned the reputation of eating up hours of computer time this problem may be attributed in part to difficulties such as slow stochastic convergence however an additional problem lies in the fact that a significant amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future events in their proper sequence this paper presents a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning future event lists in discrete event simulations there models are presented all of which improve in effectiveness as the events list scan problem becomes more burdensome cacm june 1975 wyman f p discrete event simulation simulation event scanning mechanisms 4 34 5 5 8 1 ca750611 jb january 9 1978 12 43 pm 2742 5 2742 2742 5 2742 2742 5 2742 2844 5 2742 2936 5 2742 3064 5 2742 970 6 2742 1059 6 2742 1846 6 2742 1939 6 2742 2742 6 2742 2742 6 2742 2742 6 2742 2767 6 2742 2767 6 2742 2767 6 2742 2936 6 2742
