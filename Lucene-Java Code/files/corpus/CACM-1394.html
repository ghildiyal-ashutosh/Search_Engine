computation of algebraic properties of elementary particle reactions using a digital computer a large number of calculations in high energy elementary particle physics involve the manipulation of complicated algebraic expressions containing both tensor and noncommutative matrix quantities many of these calculations take several months to complete although the operations involved follow straightforward rules in this paper a program is described which has been developed in lisp for solving such problems the manner in which these problems are encountered is outlined and their representation in the computer discussed at present about six months of human work takes less than fifteen minutes on an ibm 7090 limitations of the present system and future plans are also outlined cacm august 1966 hearn a c ca660804 jb march 2 1978 7 58 pm 1396 5 1394 1394 5 1394 1394 5 1394 1394 5 1394 964 6 1394 1028 6 1394 1029 6 1394 1083 6 1394 1132 6 1394 1214 6 1394 1278 6 1394 1334 6 1394 1365 6 1394 1386 6 1394 1387 6 1394 1388 6 1394 1392 6 1394 1393 6 1394 1394 6 1394 1395 6 1394 1396 6 1394 1397 6 1394 1496 6 1394 284 6 1394 407 6 1394 3199 6 1394 3200 6 1394 3201 6 1394 3202 6 1394 3203 6 1394 3204 6 1394 561 6 1394 730 6 1394
