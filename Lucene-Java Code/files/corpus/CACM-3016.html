a comparison of numerical techniques in markov modeling this paper presents several numerical methods which may be used to obtain the stationary probability vectors of markovian models an example of a nearly decomposable system is considered and the results obtained by the different methods examined a post mortem reveals why standard techniques often fail to yield the correct results finally a means of estimating the error inherent in the decomposition of certain models is presented cacm february 1978 stewart w markov models numerical techniques simultaneous iteration near decomposability 4 6 5 14 8 1 ca780207 jb march 28 1978 3 43 pm 2374 4 3016 2481 4 3016 2669 4 3016 2863 4 3016 3016 4 3016 3016 4 3016 3052 4 3016 3070 4 3016 3153 4 3016 1901 5 3016 2741 5 3016 3016 5 3016 3016 5 3016 3016 5 3016
