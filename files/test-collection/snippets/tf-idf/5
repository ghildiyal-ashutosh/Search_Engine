a language for treating geometric patterns in a two-dimensional space

in this paper cadep, a problem-oriented language
for positioning geometric patterns in a two-dimensional 
space, is presented.  although the language has been
specifically designed for the automatic generation 
of integrated circuit masks, it turns out to be well
suited also for such other placement problems as 
architecture design, urban planning, logical and block
diagram

logic and programming languages

logic has been long in terested in whether answers
to certain questions are computable in principle, 
since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of
formalization.  more recently, precise comparisons 
in the efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 these, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  what is a machine?
 what is a computable process?  how (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 the definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 so far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  it would seem that

legal implications of computer use

this paper points out a variety of ways computer
systems used in business and industry can 
be involved in legal entanglements and suggests that
computer specialists have a responsibility to call 
for assistance in forestalling or minimizing those entanglements
during the planning stage.  techniques 
are suggested for making legal clearance effective with
the least burden on the new technology and for 
achieving a favorable legal climate for it generally.
 computer specialists also are alerted to potential 
opportunities to interpret to lawyers the technical aspects
of computer systems

detection of three-dimensional patterns of atoms in chemical structures

an algorithm for detecting occurrences of a three-dimensional pattern of
objects within a larger structure is presented.  the search technique
presented uses the geometric structure of the pattern to define
characteristics demanded of candidates for matching. this is useful
in cases where the properties of each atom, considered individually,
do not adequately limit the number of sets of possible matchings.
several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry
are: (1) in pharmacology: searching for

the digital simulation of river plankton population dynamics

this paper deals with the development of a
mathematical model for and the digital simulation 
in fortran iv of phytoplankton and zooplankton population
densities in a river using previously developed 
rate expressions.  in order to study the relationships
between the ecological mechanisms involved, the 
simulation parameters were varied illustrating the
response of the ecosystem to different conditions, 
including those corresponding to certain types of chemical
and thermal pollution.  as an investigation 
of the accuracy of the simulation methods, a simulation
of the actual population dynamics of asterionella 
in the columbia river was made based on approximations
of conditions in that river. although not totally 
accurate, the simulation was found to predict the general
annual pattern of plankton growth fairly well 
and, specifically, revealed the importance of the annual
velocity cycle in determining such patterns. 
 in addition, the study demonstrates the usefulness of
digital simulations in the examinations of certain 
aquatic ecosystems, as well as in environmental
planning involving such examinations.

computer-made perspective movies as a scientific and communication tool*

it is easy to program the basic transformation
required for a perspective drawing.  this fact 
plus the advent of high speed microfilm printers such
as the general dynamics electronics s-c 4020 makes 
possible perspective movies as the direct output from
a computer.  the programming of such a movie is 
briefly described for studying the angular motions of
a satellite containing

given to the organization and operation of its input-output
equipment.  physical characteristics of the

music and computer composition

the problem discussed is that of simulating human
composition of western popular music by computer 
and some relevant theories of music and harmony are given.
 problems with this kind of program and several 
schemes that are known not to work are discussed.  several
previous computer compositions are discussed, 
including the illiac suite.  a program to generate short
melody fragments was written to simulate some 
of the aspects of human composition.
