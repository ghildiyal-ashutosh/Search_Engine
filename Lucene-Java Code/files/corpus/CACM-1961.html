an efficient search algorithm to find the elementary circuits of a graph a theoretically most efficient search algorithm is presented which uses an exhaustive search to find all of the elementary circuits of a graph the algorithm can be easily modified to find all of the elementary circuits with a particular attribute such as length a rigorous proof of the algorithm is given as well as an example of its application empirical bounds are presented relating the speed of the algorithm to the number of vertices and the number of arcs the speed is also related to the number of circuits in the graph to give a relation between speed and complexity extensions to undirected and s graphs are discussed cacm december 1970 tiernan j c algorithm graph theory circuit search algorithm path search algorithm searching 3 74 5 32 ca701202 jb february 9 1978 4 12 pm 1847 4 1961 1961 4 1961 1961 4 1961 1961 4 1961 2052 4 1961 2177 4 1961 2763 4 1961 1369 5 1961 1504 5 1961 1847 5 1961 1961 5 1961 1961 5 1961 1961 5 1961 2430 5 1961 1961 6 1961
