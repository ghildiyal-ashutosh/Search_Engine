Information Retrieval Project (CS 6200). The project can be divided in two phases.

Phase 1.
 Comparison between different retrieval models like tf-idf, BIM,BM25 and lucene.
 Incorporating techniques that enhances the results obtained above.
 Example: Stemming, Stopping, Query Expansion using Pseudo Relevance Model

Phase 2.
Development of a Search Engines. Evaluation of the search engine results using MAP and MRR.

*MAP : Mean Average Precision
*MRR : Mean Reciprocal Ranking
