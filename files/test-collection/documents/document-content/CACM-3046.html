computer generation of gamma random variables ii a rejection method is proposed for generating gamma variates with nonintegral shape parameter a a 1 this method is similar to other methods given by fishman wallace and tadikamalla and is faster than these methods for a 2 the core storage requirements and the programming effort for the proposed method are similar to those of wallace s or tadikamalla s methods the computational times for the proposed method remain fairly constant for medium and large values of a and are superior to times obtained by ahrens and dieter s method for all values of a the proposed method is simpler than ahrens and dieter s method cacm november 1978 tadikamalla p gamma variables rejection method computer methods 5 5 8 1 ca781105 dh january 26 1979 11 02 am 2847 4 3046 2928 4 3046 3046 4 3046 3046 4 3046 3046 4 3046 3098 4 3046 3098 4 3046 3107 4 3046 2569 5 3046 2847 5 3046 3046 5 3046 3046 5 3046 3046 5 3046 3098 5 3046
