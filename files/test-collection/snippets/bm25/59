hierarchical geometric models for visible surface 
************************
 for visible surface algorithms

the geometric structure inherent in the definition
of the shapes of three-dimensional objects 
and environments is used not just to define their relative
motion and placement, but also to assist in 
solving many other problems of systems for producing
pictures 
************************
s for producing
pictures by computer.  by using an extension of 
traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy,
five significant improvements to current 
techniques are possible.  first, the range of complexity
of an environment is greatly increased while 
the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within
a fixed upper limit.  second, a meaningful way 
is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in
a scene.  third, "clipping" becomes a very fast 
logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment
within the field of view.  fourth, frame 
to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical
"working set," or fraction of the total structure 
that should be present in primary store for immediate
access by the visible surface algorithm.  finally, 
the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent,
visible surface algorithm in which the computation 
time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.

the security of an information system may be

decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  a set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  the model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.

response time and space utilization by: (1) performing
global query optimization, (2) exploiting disjoint

in temporary relations, (4) employing directory 
analysis, and (5) maintaining locality in page references.
 algorithms for implementing the operators 
of e. f. codd's relational algebra are presented, and
a methodology for composing them to optimize the

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

management utilization of computers in american local governments

traditional concepts of management information
systems (mis) bear little relation to the information 
systems currently in use by top management in most us local
governments.  what exists is management-oriented 
computing, involving the use of relatively unsophisticated
applications.  despite the unsophisticated 
nature of these systems, management use of computing is
surprisingly common, but also varied in its extent 
among local governments.  management computing is most
prevalent in those governments with professional 
management practices where top management is supportive
of computing and tends to control computing 
************************
s to control computing decisions 
and where department users have less control over design
and implementation activities.  finally, management 
computing clearly has impacts for top managers, mostly

progressive acyclic digraphs-a tool for database integrity

a progressive 
************************
 integrity

a progressive acyclic digraph (pad) algorithm accepts are requests and
maintains a graph in an acyclic state.  when a request creates a cycle,
nodes are, "detached" until the new are can be entered acyclically
this process is important in certain areas of database implementation
in which there are constraints on the permissible sequences
of actions. two pad algorithms are presented; one uses a simple
path matrix representation and the other uses a list with an
"artificial gradient."  experiments suggest that for large n the second
is considerably faster, though both are asymptotically o(nr),
where n is the number of nodes and r is the expected number
of nodes reachable along paths from any given node.

considered,

considered, and emphasis is placed on the relative 
merits of the mtpt scheduling discipline with respect
to the shortest-latency-time-first (sltf) scheduling

is unconditionally superior to the other.  for most
fixed-head drum applications, the sltf discipline 
is preferable to mtpt, but for intra-cylinder disk scheduling
the mtpt discipline offers a distinct advantage 
over the sltf discipline.  the computational requirements
of an algorithm that implements the mtpt scheduling 
discipline are shown to be comparable to sltf algorithms.
in both cases, the sorting procedure is the 
most time-consuming phase of the algorithm.

optimal space allocation on disk storage devices

when the amount of space required for file storage
exceeds the amount which can be kept on-line, 
decisions must be made as to which files are to be permanently
resident and which mountable.  these decisions 
will affect the number of mount requests issued to the
operators.  this is often a bottleneck in a computing 
facility, and reducing the number of mounts thus decreases
turnaround time.  an optimization model for 
the assignment of files to disk packs, and packs to either
resident or nonresident status is presented. 
 heuristics are suggested for those cases in which
it is inefficient to compute the actual optimum.

a comparative analysis of disk scheduling policies

five well-known scheduling policies for movable
head disks are compared using the performance 
criteria of expected seek time (system oriented)and expected
waiting time (individual i/o request oriented). 
 both analytical and simulation results are obtained.
 the variance of waiting time is introduced as 
another meaningful measure of performance, showing possible
discrimination against individual requests. 
 then the choice of a utility function to measure total
performance including system oriented and individual 
request oriented measures is described.  such a function
allows one to differentiate among the scheduling 
policies over a wide range of input loading conditions.
 the selection and implementation of a maximum 
performance two-policy algorithm are discussed.

of generalized data base management systems.  this introduction

************************
.  this introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  after some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  the first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  the problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  the use of cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  this
section also assesses the effect of the data base 
task group proposals.  the final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed.
 it is predicted that the use of tags to 
identify capabilities will dominate.  a hardware address
translation scheme which never requires the 
modification of the representation of capabilities is
suggested. the scheme uses a main memory hash table 
for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given
its unique code.  the hash table is avoided for
recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative
registers.  a computer using capability-based 
addressing may be substantially superior to present
systems on the basis of protection,
