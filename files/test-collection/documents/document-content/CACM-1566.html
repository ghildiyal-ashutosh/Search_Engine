optimal starting values for newton raphson calculation of sqrt x the problem of obtaining starting values for the newton raphson calculation of sqrt x on a digital computer is considered it is shown that the conventionally used best uniform approximations to sqrt x do not provide optimal starting values the problem of obtaining optimal starting values the problem of obtaining optimal starting values is stated and several basic results are proved a table of optimal polynomial starting values is given cacm july 1967 moursund d g ca670707 jb february 28 1978 8 53 am 1566 4 1566 1440 5 1566 1566 5 1566 1566 5 1566 1566 5 1566 1932 5 1566 2094 5 1566 962 6 1566 1566 6 1566 1566 6 1566
