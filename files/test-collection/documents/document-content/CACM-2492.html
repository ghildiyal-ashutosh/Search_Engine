the development of decision tables via parsing of complex decision situations a new parsing technique is proposed which allows parsing based only on syntactical characteristics of the decision problem it requires a description of the problem in decision grid chart format and allows the development of decision tables within defined limits by avoiding or at least minimizing repetition of conditions and actions in the resulting tables cacm june 1973 strunz h decision tables parsing decision grid chart problem analysis 4 0 4 1 4 2 ca730608 jb january 23 1978 2 10 pm 2220 4 2492 2492 4 2492 2518 4 2492 2598 4 2492 2616 4 2492 2726 4 2492 1548 5 2492 2492 5 2492 2492 5 2492 2492 5 2492
