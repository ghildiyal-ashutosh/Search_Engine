the qr iteration for the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can 
be accelerated by incorporating a sequence of origin shifts.  the origin shift
may be either subtracted directly from the diagonal elements of
the matrix or incorporated by means of an implicit algorithm.  both
methods have drawbacks: the

cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems

a cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.  the chief computational advantage 
offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed
achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel 
processing.  in this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  for example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  a major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions 
************************
 for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  in particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, pert chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 these algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  straightforward

cellular implementations of the well-known

n^2 to n^3 steps.

generation of rosary permutations expressed in hamiltonian circuits

systematic generation of a specific class
of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems 
is described.  in a nonoriented complete graph with

permutations, can be defined.  each of them

 every set of edges {e[k]}, 1 <= e[k] <= k,

a hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices, starting with

vertices where the position of the pair in

tridiagonalization by permutations

tridiagonalizing a matrix by similarity transformations
is an important computational tool 
in numerical linear algebra. consider the class of sparse
matrices which can be tridiagonalized using 
only row and corresponding column permutations.  the
advantages of using such a transformation include 
the absence of round-off errors and improved computation time
when compared with standard transformations. 
 a graph theoretic algorithm which examines an arbitrary
n x n matrix and determines whether or not it 
can be permuted into tridiagonal form is given.  the
algorithm requires no arithmetic while the number 
of comparisons, the number of assignments, and the number
of increments are linear in n.  this compares 
very favorably with standard transformation methods.
 if the matrix is permutable into tridiagonal form, 
the algorithm gives the explicit tridiagonal form.
 otherwise, early rejection will occur.

on the optimal detection of curves in noisy pictures

a technique for recognizing systems of lines
is presented.  in this technique the heuristic 
of the problem is not embedded in the recognition algorithm
but is expressed in a figure of merit.   
a multistage decision process is then able to recognize
in the input picture the optimal system of lines 
according to the given figure of merit.  due to the
global approach, greater flexibility and adequacy 
in the particular problem is achieved.  the relation
between the structure of the figure of merit and 
the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed.
 the method described is suitable for parallel 
processing because the operations relative to each
state can be computed in parallel, and the number
of stages is equal to the length n of the curves (or
to log2 n if the approximate method is used).

new methods to color the vertices of a graph

this paper describes efficient new heuristic
methods to color the vertices of a graph which rely
upon the comparison of the degrees and structure of a graph.  a method
is developed which is exact for bipartite graphs and is an
important part of heuristic procedures to find maximal cliques in general
graphs.  finally an exact method is given which performs better
than the randall-brown algorithm and is able to color larger
graphs, and the new heuristic methods, the classical methods, and
the exact method are compared.

determination of the intersection points of two
plane curves by means of differential equations

a new method is proposed to calculate the intersection
points of two plane curves.  the theory 
of singular points off a system of two differential equations
is used in developing the method. the intersection 
point to be determined is identified with such a singular
point and appropriate modifications are applied 
to the system to ensure that the singular point be stable,
i.e. all integrals which start in the neighborhood 
of the singular point will always approach this point
if the integral parameter tends to infinity.  in 
addition a method is described for systematically searching
for all intersection points in a prescribed 
rectangular area.

scheduling to reduce conflict in meetings

conflicts in scheduling can be treated as defining an undirected linear graph 
independently of the relation of the activities in conflict to additional 
constraints of time and space.  each connected component of such a graph,
which can be found by an algorithm described by gotlieb and corneil, 
corresponds to a set of events that must be scheduled at different times.

a note on information organization and storage

since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 a general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  there are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  the use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different

************************
 results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 the results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

methods described in this paper.  a procedure is given
which determines all the definitions which can
possibly "reach" each node of the control flow graph
of the program and all the definitions that are 
"live" on each edge of the graph.  the procedure uses
an "interval" ordered edge listing data structure 
and handles reducible and irreducible graphs indistinguishably.

a graph formulation of a school scheduling algorithm

the problem classically titled "the examination
schedule problem" takes various forms in the 
literature.  most of these formulations can be presented
in the terminology of classical network theory. 
 one such formulation is:  given a nondirected network,
partition its nodes into a minimal number of 
subsets such that no two members of the same subset
are connected by anarc.  an obvious lower limit 
to this number is the size of the largest strongly connected
subgraph.  kirchgassner proved that an upper 
limit is this size plus one.  one logical extension of
the previous work is the introduction of variable 
length examinations where w(i) is the number of periods
for exam i.  the object of this paper is to generalize 
the definition of largest strongly connected subgraph
to include the weighting of nodes, to present an 
approximate algorithm which usually finds the largest
