on the probability distribution of the values of binary trees

an integral equation is derived for the generating
function for binary tree values, the values 
reflecting sorting effort. the analysis does not assume
uniformly distributed branching ratios, and 
therefore is applicable to a family of sorting algorithms
discussed by hoare, singleton, and van emden. 
 the solution to the integral equation indicates that
using more advanced algorithms in the family makes 
only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort,
but substantially reduces the variance in sorting 
effort.  statistical tests of the values of several

the application of sequential sampling
to simulation: an example inventory model

four different sequential sampling procedures are applied
to the analysis of data generated by a computer simulation
experiment with a multi-item inventory model.  for each procedure
the cost of computer time required to achieve given levels of
statistical precision is calculated.  also the cost of computer time
using comparable fixed sample size methods is calculated.  the
computer costs of fixed sample size procedures versus
sequential sampling procedures are compared.

a statistical model for console behavior in multiuser computers

the ability of a computer system to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
it is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 no claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  using the model we answer questions like: 
how many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  what is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  what bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system 
design.

a simple algorithm for computing the generalized inverse of a matrix

the generalized inverse of a matrix is important
in analysis because it provides an extension 
of the concept of an inverse which applies to all matrices.
 it also has many applications in numerical 
analysis, but it is not widely used because the existing
algorithms are fairly complicated and require 
considerable storage space.  a simple extension has
been found to the conventional orthogonalization 
method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives
the generalized inverse with little extra effort 
and with no additional storage requirements.  the algorithm
gives the generalized inverse for any m by 
n matrix a, including the special case when m+n and a
is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(a) 
= n.  in the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary
inverse of a.  in the second case the algorithm 
yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix
inv(a'a)a' and has the advantage of avoiding 
the loss of significance which results

a modification of efroymson's technique for stepwise regression analysis

the computational technique conventionally used
for stepwise multiple linear regression requires 
the storage of an n x n matrix of data.  when the number
of variables, n, is large, this requirement 
taxes the storage capacity of presently used machinery.
 the near symmetry of the matrices involved permits 
a modification requiring only half the storage and computations
of the conventional algorithm and this 
additional storage allows the analysis of problems containing
more variables.  alternatively, it permits 
the analysis of problems containing the same number
of variables but with all computations performed 
in double precision.

four algorithms for the numerical computation

"accuracy."  each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditions
under which it will be accurate.  we conclude that all four
algorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems, but two
of the algorithms, one new, one old, are substantially more accurate
on difficult problems than are the other two.
