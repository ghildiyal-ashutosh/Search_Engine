an interference matching technique for inducing abstractions

a method for inducing knowledge by abstraction
from a sequence of training examples is described. 
 the proposed method, interference matching, induces abstractions
by finding relational properties common 
to two or more exemplars.  three tasks solved by a program
that uses an interference-matching algorithm 
are presented.  several problems concerning the description
of the training examples and the adequacy 
of interference matching are discussed, and directions
for future research are considered.

considerations in the design of a multiple
computer system with extended core storage

the use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  the general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual cdc 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  in the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 an observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

a proposal for a computer-based interactive scientific community

because of the problems created by the explosion
of papers in the mathematical sciences and 
the drawbacks that this places on research, it is suggested
that a tree of all mathematical results and 
terminology be maintained in a multiterminal computer system.
 users of the system can store in the computer 
an updated file of their current knowledge, and on selecting
a paper to read, they can obtain from the 
computer the minimum subtree of theorems required to bring
them from what they already know to the background 
knowledge which the paper assumes.  under certain conditions,
means are also provided for the contribution 
of useful comments by the readers of a work and for interaction
between commentators and with the author. 
 this paper describes how the system can be organized
and the role required of readers, writers, and 
commentators.

a vector space model for automatic indexing

in a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  an approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model.

automatic derivation of microsentences

the decomposition of long complex english sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  to explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the harvard multipath analysis program.  the basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  a program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 the authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems, they may have practical

a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by lewin, is based on the use of special 
************************
 on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  the use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  in this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

introduction to "feature analysis of
generalized data base management systems"

this paper is a separately published introduction
to a main report which analyzes the features 
of generalized data base management systems.  this introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  after some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  the first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  the problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  the use of cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  this
section also assesses the effect of the data base 
task group proposals.  the final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

a note on information organization and storage

since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 a general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  there are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  the use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 the results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  these criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  to define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.
