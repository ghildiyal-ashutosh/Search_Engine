a linear sieve algorithm for finding prime numbers a new algorithm is presented for finding all primes between 2 and n the algorithm executes in time proportional to n assuming that multiplication of integers not larger than n can be performed in unit time the method has the same arithmetic complexity as the algorithm presented by mairson 6 however our version is perhaps simpler and more elegant it is also easily extended to find the prime factorization of all integers between 2 and n in time proportional to n cacm december 1978 gries d misra j primes algorithms data structures 5 25 5 24 5 29 ca781202 dh january 22 1979 11 12 am 2896 4 3037 2972 4 3037 3037 4 3037 3037 4 3037 3039 4 3037 3043 4 3037 3073 4 3037 2732 5 3037 2927 5 3037 3037 5 3037 3037 5 3037 3037 5 3037
