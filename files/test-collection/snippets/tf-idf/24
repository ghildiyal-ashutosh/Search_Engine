on the optimization of performance of time-sharing systems by simulation

a simulation 
************************
 by simulation

a simulation model of a time-sharing system
with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite 
auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system
parameters such as store size, number of jobs 
allowed to execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm,
etc.  the effects of these variations on 
a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which
of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  system performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 it is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  it appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm
affect system performance in a predictable 
manner and would not benefit from optimization.  features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, 
the size of the store, and the speed of the cpu.  a comparison
is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  the comparison 
is

interval arithmetic determinant evaluation
and its use in testing for a chebyshev system

two recent papers, one by hansen and one by
hansen and r. r. smith, have shown how interval 
arithmetic (i.) can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations.  in the present paper 
a method proposed by hasen and r. r. smith is compared
with straightforward use of i. in determinant 
evaluation.  computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
i. for determinant evaluation.  an application using
i. determinants in a program to test a set of 
functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented.

considerations in the design of a multiple
computer system with extended core storage

the use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system

************************
 of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  the general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual cdc 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  in the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 an observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

growing applications of linear programming

use of linear programming models has grown so
extensively in recent years that the whole concept 
for organizing a computer code has undergone a radical
change.  it no longer is adequate merely to reduce 
a mathematical algorithm (i.e. the simplex method) to
a computer code.  an advanced code must cope with

subprograms must be organized into an integrated 
system.  emphasis in this paper is devoted to the underlying
principles upon which future linear programming 
systems must be based.  these

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at 
************************
 sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

a software design and evaluation system

a critical failure of current software system
design and implementation methodology is that 
the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented.  in this paper 
the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed.  a system which integrates performance evaluation
with design and implementation is described. 
 this system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  the source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines.  using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications system

a study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system.  it is
concluded that while, for certain values of system 
parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer (model), in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance.  analytical and simulation results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an m/d/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem
with a single exponential server (the computer). 
 analytical results include a general description of the
output process of an m/d/1 queue and the conditions 
under which this output process is approximately poisson.

a comparative analysis of disk scheduling policies

five well-known scheduling policies for movable
head disks are compared using the performance 
criteria of expected seek time (system oriented)and expected
waiting time (individual i/o request oriented). 
 both analytical and simulation results are obtained.
 the variance of waiting time is introduced as 
another meaningful measure of performance, showing possible
discrimination against individual requests. 
 then the choice of a utility function to measure total
performance including system oriented and individual 
request oriented measures is described.  such a function
allows one to differentiate among the scheduling 
policies over a wide range of input loading conditions.
 the selection and implementation of a maximum 
performance two-policy algorithm are discussed.

theoretical considerations in information retrieval systems

information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  for identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by goffman, verhoeff and belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  for searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  the inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  one is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a

performance monitoring in a time-sharing system

a software measurement facility which is part of
a general purpose time-sharing system is described. 
 the date collection facility (dcf) has been implemented
in the michigan terminal system (mts) for the 
system/360 model 67.  it exists for the purpose of monitoring
operating system and user program behavior 
and performance.  the overall structure of mts is outlined
in order to explain the implementation of 
the dcf.  events in the system are identified and recorded
from within the supervisor, and dumped to 
magnetic tape by an auxiliary program for off-line processing.
 events in user programs which are unrelated 
to system actions are recorded with a supervisor call.
 the time of occurrence of each event is accurately 
recorded, and data items are further identified by job and
type.  the overhead associated with data collection 
and its interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed,
and both are shown to be minimal.  several 
examples are given of information obtained with the
facility and of applications in which it has been 
useful.  some general guidelines are offered for
the construction of future monitoring programs.
