computer generation of gamma random variates with non integral shape parameters when the shape parameter a is integral generating gamma random variables with a digital computer is straightforward there is no simple method for generating gamma random variates with non integral shape parameters a common procedure is to approximately generate such random variables by use of the so called probability switch method another procedure which is exact is due to johnk this paper presents a rejection method for exactly generating gamma random variables when a is greater than 1 the efficiency of the rejection method is shown to be better than the efficiency of johnk s method the paper concludes that when a is non integral the following mix of procedures yields the best combination of accuracy and efficiency 1 when a is less than 1 use johnk s method 2 when 1 is less than a and a is less than 5 use the rejection method 3 when a is greater than 5 use the probability switch method cacm december 1974 wallace n d simulation gamma random variables probability distribution random numbers 5 5 8 1 ca741205 jb january 16 1978 9 35 am 2569 5 2569 2569 5 2569 2569 5 2569 2847 5 2569 2928 5 2569 3046 5 2569 3098 5 2569 3107 5 2569 1751 6 2569 2277 6 2569 2380 6 2569 2522 6 2569 2569 6 2569 2569 6 2569 2569 6 2569 2569 6 2569 2569 6 2569 2847 6 2569 2847 6 2569 3098 6 2569
