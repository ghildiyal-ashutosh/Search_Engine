a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at

the teachable language comprehender: 
a simulation program and theory of language

the teachable language comprehender (tlc) is
a program designed to be capable of being taught 
to "comprehend" english text.  when text which the program
has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends 
that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit)
assertion of the new text to a large memory. 
 this memory is a "semantic network" representing factual
assertions about the world.  the program also 
creates copies of the parts of its memory which have
been found to relate to the new text, adapting and 
combining these copies to represent the meaning of the
new text.  by this means, the meaning of all text 
the program successfully comprehends is encoded into
the same format as that of the memory.  in this 
form it can be added into the memory.  both factual
assertions for the memory and the capabilities for 
correctly relating text to the memory's prior content
are to be taught to the program as they are needed. 
 tlc presently contains a relatively small number of
examples of such assertions and

time-sharing systems, as defined in this article,
are those multiaccess systems which permit 
a terminal user to utilize essentially the full resources
of the system while sharing its time with other 
terminal users.  it is each terminal user's ability
to utilize the full resources of the system that 
makes quantitative evaluation of time-sharing systems
particularly difficult.  six criteria are described

requirements for advanced programming systems for list processing

list processing systems should be designed to
facilitate production of large programs to manipulate 
large complex symbolic data stores.  this paper presents
an overview of a number of system features which 
the author feels are important to improve the productivity
of programmers working in such domains.  a

features, since algorithms must be not only 
coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made
efficient, and run on data.  because of this general 
framework,the requirements specified are applicable
to the design of advanced programming systems for 
a wide range of applications.  three aspects of programming
systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  interactive 
features are described to facilitate program

of various control regimes including multiprocesses,

of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  the  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.  syntax directed

applications of differential equations in general problem solving

a large class of problems leading to digital
computer processing can be formulated in terms 
of the numerical solution of systems of ordinary differential
equations.  powerful methods are in existence 
for the solution of such systems.  a good general purpose
routine for the solution of such systems furnishes 
a powerful tool for processing many problems.  this is
true from the point of view of ease of programming, 
ease of debugging, and minimization of computer time.

estimates of distributions of random variables
for certain computer communications traffic models

a study of multiaccess computer communications has
characterized the distributions underlying an elementary
 model of the user-computer interactive process.  the model used is
elementary in the sense that many of the random variables that
generally are of interest in computer communications studies can be
decomposed into the elements of this model.  data were examined
from four operational multiaccess systems, and the model is shown to
be robust; that is each of the variables of the model has the
same distribution independent of which of the four systems is being examined. 
it is shown that the gamma distribution can be used to
describe the discrete variables.

a system for typesetting mathematics

this paper describes the design and implementation
of a system for typesetting mathematics. 
 the language has been designed to be easy to learn
and to use by people (for example, secretaries and 
mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor
typesetting.  experience indicates that the language 
can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules
and fewer exceptions.  for typical expressions, 
the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and
the like necessary to print according to mathematical 
conventions are all done automatically.  for example,
the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 
2 produces (formula).  the syntax of the language is specified
by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler 
is used to make a compiler that translates this language
into typesetting commands.  output maybe produced 
on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward
and reverse half-line motions.  the system 
interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so

introduction to "feature analysis of

this paper is a separately published introduction
to a main report which analyzes the features 
of generalized data base management systems.  this introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  after some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  technical problems 
************************
d.  technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  the first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  the problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  the use of cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  this
section also assesses the effect of the data base 
task group proposals.  the final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.
