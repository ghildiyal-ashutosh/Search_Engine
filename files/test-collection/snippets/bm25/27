an application of formac

a nonlinear circuit analysis problem is stated
and the way in which it was solved using formac 
is indicated.  the solution of the problem using formac
was notable since several other methods that 
were tried failed.  the problem is straightforward (although
untenable by hand) but nevertheless involved 
an elaborate use of the formac language.  the program
was fairly large and utilized practically every 
command.  in particular, it made extensive use of the
part command.  several tricks were necessary in 
order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the
formac system.  this paper is more concerned with 
the use of programming techniques in formac than with
the actual engineering problem, although readers

reverse path forwarding of broadcast packets

a broadcast packet is for delivery to all
nodes of a network.  algorithms for accomplishing 
this delivery through a store-and-forward packet switching
 computer network include (1) transmission 
of separately addressed packets. (2) multidestination
addressing, (3) hot potato forwarding,(4) spanning 
tree forwarding, and (5) source based forwarding.  to
this list of algorithms we add (6) reverse path 
forwarding, a broadcast routing method which exploits
routing procedures and data structures already 
available for packet switching.  reverse path forwarding
is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing 
 in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks.
 the algorithm is described

 the algorithm is described as being practical 
 because it is not optimal according to metrics developed
for its analysis in this paper, and also because 
it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity

a relational model of data for large shared data banks

future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the 
data is organized in the machine (the internal representation).  a prompting
service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory
solution.  activities of users at terminals and most application
programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation
of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation 
are changed.  change in data representation will often be needed as a result 
of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the 
types of stored information.  existing noninferential, formatted data systems 
provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network 
models of the data.  in section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.
a model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations,
and the concept of a universal form for data base relations,
and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.  in
section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical
inference) are discussed and applied to the problems
of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.

of natural language sentences is described.  structure-building
actions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering,
restructuring, and copying of constituents necessary to produce
deep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from a
transformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow for a
powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take

the effective operation of free enterprise in
creating the envisioned information service industry 
is dependent upon three accomplishments: (1) the restructuring
of our information processing industry 
so that a clear division of costs is made among computing,
communications, and the development of information 
services; (2) the wide use of multiaccess system concepts
so that information services may share in the 
use of computer installations and so that the cost of their
construction is reasonable; and (3) the development 
of public, message-switched communications services so
that adequate provisions are made for information

on quadratic adaptive routing algorithms

two analytic models 
************************


two analytic models of a store-and-forward communications
network are constructed, one to find 
the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate
the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained 
by an adaptive routing algorithm.  these models show that
adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  the form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  the modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  simulation results are presented 
which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.

dynamic verification of operating system decisions

dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  the dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the prime system
being designed and constructed at the university 
of california, berkeley.  prime is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 the technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  on prime,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available

value conflicts and social choice in electronic
funds transfer system developments

during the last few years, computer-based
systems which automate the transfer and recording 
of debits and credits have begun to be implemented on
a large scale.  these systems promise both financial 
benefits for the institutions that use them and potential
conveniences to their customers.  however, 
they also raise significant social, legal, and technical
questions that must be resolved if full scale 
systems for electronic funds transfer (eft) are not
to cause more problems for the larger public than 
they solve.  this paper examines the incentives for eft
developments and the social problems they raise 
in the context of conflicts between five different value
positions that are often implicit in analyses 
of proposed eft arrangements.  these conflicts reflect
the relative importance of certain problems for 
specific groups.  the value positions implicit in eft proposals
help to organize analyses of market arrangements, 
system reliability, and privacy of transactions.  these
topics are analyzed in this article and related 
to the value positions held by concerned parties.  last,
the ways in which the public can learn about 
the social qualities of different eft arrangements and
the pace of eft developments are both discussed 
in the context of social choice.

the multics virtual memory: concepts and design

as experience with use of on-line operating
systems has grown, the need to share information 
among system users has become increasingly apparent.
 many contemporary systems permit some degree of 
sharing.  usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing
several users to share data via input and output 
of information stored in files kept in secondary storage.
 through the use of segmentation, however, 
multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and

************************
 addressing by user and
system programs of all information, independent 
of its physical storage location.  information is stored
in segments each of which is potentially sharable 
and carries its own independent attributes of size and access
privilege.  here, the design and implementation 
considerations of segmentation and sharing in multics
are first discussed under the assumption that all 
information resides in large, segmented main memory. 
since the size of main memory on contemporary systems 
is rather limited, it is then shown how the multics
software achieves the effect of a large segmented 
main memory through the use of the honeywell
645 segmentation and paging hardware.

muse: a model to understand simple english

muse is a computer model for natural language
processing, based on a semantic memory network 
like that of quillian's tlc.  muse, from a model to understand
simple english, processes english sentences 
of unrestricted content but somewhat restricted format.
 the model first applies syntactic analysis to 
eliminate some interpretations and then employs a simplified
semantic intersection procedure to find 
a valid interpretation of the input.  while the semantic
processing is similar to tlc's, the syntactic 
component includes the early use of parse trees and special
purpose rules.  the "relational triple" notation 
used during interpretation of input is compatible with muse's
memory structures, allowing direct verification 
of familiar concepts and the addition of new ones. 
muse also has a repertoire of actions, which range 
from editing and reporting the contents of its own
memory to an indirect form of question answering. 
 examples are presented to demonstrate how the model interprets
text, resolves ambiguities, adds information

pictorial pattern recognition and the
phase problem of x-ray crystallography

the availability of interactive, three-dimensional,
computer graphics systems coupled to powerful 
digital computers encourages the development of algorithms
adapted to this environment.  pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to x-ray structure determination based on 
molecular model building, i.e. the use of chemical information
to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 however, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  a simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  this is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

subsystem (including the supervisor) is identical 
to a call to a companion user procedure.  the mechanisms

introduction to "feature analysis of
generalized data base management systems"

this paper is a separately published introduction
to a main report which analyzes the features 
of generalized data base management systems.  this introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  after some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  the first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  the problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  the use of cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  this
section also assesses the effect of the data base 
task group proposals.  the final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

the control of response times in multi-class
systems by memory allocations 

the possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different
classes by regulating their memory allocation is examined in
the context of a paged computer system.  two parameterized algorithms
which partition the main memory between two classes of jobs are
considered.  initially, a closed system consisting of a process
or and paging and file devices, with fixed numbers of jobs, is studied
to determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportion
of processor time devoted to each class.  applying a decomposition
approach and treating the closed system as a single server,
the response times in an open system with external arrivals are
studied.  the object is to investigate the effect of the memory
alocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms.
numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for the
expected response times as functions of the control parameters
are obtained.  a way of applying the results to systems with more
than two job classes is indicated.

cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems

a cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.  the chief computational advantage 
offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed
achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel 
processing.  in this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  for example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  a major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  in particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, pert chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

progressive acyclic digraphs-a tool for database integrity

a progressive acyclic digraph (pad) algorithm accepts are requests and
maintains a graph in an acyclic state.  when a request creates a cycle,
nodes are, "detached" until the new are can be entered acyclically
this process is important in certain areas of database implementation
in which there are constraints on the permissible sequences
of actions. two pad algorithms are presented; one uses a simple
path matrix representation and the other uses a list with an
"artificial gradient."  experiments suggest that for large n the second
is considerably faster, though both are asymptotically o(nr),
where n is the number of nodes and r is the expected number
of nodes reachable along paths from any given node.

because it provides the needed absolute address.

registers.  a computer using capability-based
