decomposability instabilities and saturation in multiprogramming systems a step by step approach to model the dynamic behavior and evaluate the performance of computing systems is proposed it is based on a technique of variable aggregation and the concept of nearly decomposable system both borrowed from econometrics this approach is taken in order to identify in multiprogramming paging systems i unstable regimes of operations and ii critical computing loads which bring the system into states of saturation this analysis leads to a more complete definition of the circumstances in which thrashing can set in cacm july 1975 courtois p j multiprogramming paging performance evaluation saturation instabilities thrashing aggregation system levels hierarchy networks of queues 4 31 4 32 8 1 8 2 ca750701 jb january 9 1978 10 39 am 1828 4 2741 1854 4 2741 1877 4 2741 1892 4 2741 1960 4 2741 2068 4 2741 2150 4 2741 2317 4 2741 2319 4 2741 2377 4 2741 2342 4 2741 2376 4 2741 2379 4 2741 2424 4 2741 2482 4 2741 2618 4 2741 2632 4 2741 2704 4 2741 2712 4 2741 2723 4 2741 2738 4 2741 2740 4 2741 2741 4 2741 2741 4 2741 2741 4 2741 2867 4 2741 3070 4 2741 3184 4 2741 1526 5 2741 1749 5 2741 2454 5 2741 2741 5 2741 2741 5 2741 2741 5 2741 3016 5 2741 3070 5 2741 3153 5 2741 1805 6 2741 1901 6 2741 2454 6 2741 2741 6 2741 2741 6 2741 2741 6 2741 2891 6 2741 2988 6 2741
