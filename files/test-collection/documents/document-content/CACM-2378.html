an operating system based on the concept of a supervisory computer an operating system which is organized as a small supervisor and a set of independent processes are described the supervisor handles i o with external devices the file and directory system schedules active processes and manages memory handle errors and provides a small set of primitive functions which it will execute for a process a process is able to specify a request for a complicated action on the part of the supervisor usually a wait on the occurrence of a compound event in the system by combining these primitives into a supervisory computer program the part of the supervisor which executes these programs may be viewed as a software implemented supervisory computer the paper develops these concepts in detail outlines the remainder of the supervisor and discusses some of the advantages of this approach cacm march 1972 gaines r s operating systems supervisors multiprogramming time sharing cooperating processes 4 30 4 31 4 32 ca720303 jb january 31 1978 3 08 pm 1458 4 2378 1523 4 2378 1603 4 2378 1698 4 2378 1747 4 2378 1748 4 2378 1854 4 2378 1877 4 2378 1960 4 2378 2319 4 2378 2377 4 2378 2378 4 2378 2378 4 2378 2320 4 2378 2497 4 2378 2558 4 2378 2625 4 2378 2632 4 2378 2632 4 2378 2738 4 2378 2740 4 2378 2840 4 2378 2868 4 2378 2941 4 2378 3105 4 2378 3127 4 2378 3144 4 2378 1471 5 2378 2080 5 2378 2378 5 2378 2378 5 2378 2378 5 2378
