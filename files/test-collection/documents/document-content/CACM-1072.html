an improved equivalence algorithm an algorithm for assigning storage on the basis of equivalence dimension and common declarations is presented the algorithm is based on a tree structure and has reduced computation time by 40 percent over a previously published algorithm by identifying all equivalence classes with one scan of the equivalence declarations the method is applicable in any problem in which it is necessary to identify equivalence classes given the element pairs defining the equivalence relation cacm may 1964 galler b a fisher m j ca640517 jb march 9 1978 11 48 pm 1072 4 1072 1781 4 1072 1072 5 1072 1072 5 1072 1072 5 1072 1646 5 1072 316 5 1072 830 6 1072 987 6 1072 1072 6 1072 1179 6 1072 1647 6 1072 680 6 1072
