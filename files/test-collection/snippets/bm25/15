a user authentication scheme not requiring secrecy in the computer

in many computer operating systems a user authenticates

************************
 a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system.  the system compares
this password with one recorded in a password 
table which is available to only the authentication
program.  the integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret.  in this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer.    all aspects of the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  the scheme is based
on using a function h which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  this function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  the intruder may know all about h and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert h to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  this paper discusses
issues surrounding selection of a suitable h.  two 
different plausible arguments are given that penetration
would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then 
argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.  finally,
some human engineering problems relating to 
the scheme are discussed.

the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications system

a study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system.  it is
concluded that while, for certain values of system 
parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer (model), in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance.  analytical and simulation results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an m/d/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem
with a single exponential server (the computer). 
 analytical results include a general description of the
output process of an m/d/1 queue and the conditions 
under which this output process is approximately poisson.

the design of the venus operating system

the venus operating system is an experimental
multiprogramming system which supports five or 
six concurrent users on a small computer.  the system was
produced to test the effect of machine architecture 
on complexity of software.  the system is defined by
a combination of microprograms and software.  the 
microprogram defines a machine with some unusual architectural
feature; the software exploits these features 
to define the operating system as simply as possible.
 in this paper the development of the system is 
described, with particular emphasis on the principles which guided the design.

experiments in automatic learning for a multipurpose heuristic program

an automatic learning capability has been developed
and implemented for use with the multiple 
(multipurpose program that learns) heuristic tree-searching
program, which is presently being applied 
to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus.
multiple's proving program (pp) uses two evaluation 
functions to guide its search for a proof of whether

general features of predicate calculus clauses were created
for use in the automatic learning of better

considerations in the design of a multiple
computer system with extended core storage

the use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  the general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual cdc 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  in the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 an observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

a statistical model for console behavior in multiuser computers

the ability of a computer system to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
it is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 no claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  using the model we answer questions like: 
how many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  what is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  what bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system 
design.

on the implementation of security measures in information systems

the security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  a set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  the model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.

interference between communicating parallel processes

various kinds of interference between communicating
parallel processes have been examined by 
dijkstra, knuth, and others.  solutions have been given
for the mutual exclusion problem and associated 
subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informal
proofs of correctness have been given for 
these solutions.  in this paper a system of parallel
processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds 
from one state s (i.e. a collection of pertinent data
values and process configurations) to a next state 
s' in accordance with a transition rule s --> s'.  a
set of such rules yields sequences of states, which 
dictate the system's behavior.  the mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  a mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  it is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 the formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

a software design and evaluation system

a critical failure of current software system
design and implementation methodology is that 
the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented.  in this paper 
the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed.  a system which integrates performance evaluation
with design and implementation is described. 
 this system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  the source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines.  using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

of our information processing industry 
so that a clear division of costs is made among computing,
communications, and the development of information 
services; (2) the wide use of multiaccess system concepts
so that information services may share in the 
use of computer installations and so that the cost of their
construction is reasonable; and (3) the development

dynamic verification of operating system decisions

dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  the dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the prime system
being designed and constructed at the university 
of california, berkeley.  prime is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 the technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  on prime,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

logic and programming languages

logic has been long in terested in whether answers
to certain questions are computable in principle, 
since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of
formalization.  more recently, precise comparisons 
in the efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 these, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  what is a machine?
 what is a computable process?  how (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes.

automatic derivation of microsentences

the decomposition of long complex english sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  to explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the harvard multipath analysis program.  the basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  a program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 the authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems, they may have practical

a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems

an encryption method is presented with the novel
property that publicly revealing an encryption 
key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key.  this has two important consequences: (1) 
couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit
keys, since a message can be enciphered using 
an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient.
 only he can decipher the message, since 
only he knows the corresponding decryption key.  (2)
a message can be "signed" using a privately held 
decryption key.  anyone can verify this signature using
the corresponding publicly revealed encryption 
key.  signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot
later deny the validity of his signature.  this 
has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic
funds transfer" systems.  a message is 
encrypted by representing it as a number m, raising
m to a publicly specified power e, and then taking 
the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly
specified product, n, of two large secret prime 
numbers p and q.  decryption is similar;only a different,
secret, power d is used, where e * d = 1 (mod(p-1) 
* (q-1)).  the security of the system rests in part on
the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, 
n.

a general-purpose display processing and tutorial system

adept (a display-expedited processing and tutorial)
system is described.  this system was designed 
to improve man-computer communications by employing
a display unit to interleave tutoring with other 
computer operations such as simulation, programming, and
information retrieval.  it is written in fortran 
iv (g) for the ibm system/360, model 40, and the ibm 2250
display unit under operating system/360.  adept 
is a cataloged program that controls the standard operating
system by terminating and rescheduling itself 
automatically, relinquishing computer resources allocated
to it, and surrendering control to the operating 
system to perform other jobs.  it expands the power
and flexibility of computer-assisted instruction 
by making immediately available to students, teachers,
and other users, the full resources (system-cataloged 
programs) of the operating system.  language processors
and compilers, simulation models, mathematical 
solution techniques, stored data, and all other library and
user programs can be incorporated into instructional 
material without reprogramming.  illustrations of the various
applications are presented and their implications 
are discussed.

a computer analysis method for thermal diffusion in biochemical systems

in the thermal detection of rapid biochemical
reactions it is necessary to correct the temperature 
data for transient heat conduction losses in a cylindrical
calorimeter.  to handle the complexities arising 
from varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulating
layers, a computer program was developed 
which gives the temperature distribution of the system
as a function of radius and time.  this distribution 
is corrected at each step by a subroutine which calculates
the instantaneous chemical state of there 
action, as well as the heat produced by this reaction.
 the program is based on a direct statement of 
fourier's law of heat conduction and the chemical rate
equation to provide a "bookkeeping law" to follow 
the reactants and the flow of heat packets, in such a
way that the computer continually stores the heat 
distribution.  a computer analysis method is here regarded
as one in which the physical laws of a process 
are used explicitly in the program. usually this results
in by passing much of the mathematical

on a solution to the cigarette smoker's
problem (without conditional statements)

this report discusses a problem first introduced
by patil, who has claimed that the cigarette 
smoker's problem cannot be solved using the p and v operations
introduced by dijkstra unless conditional 
statements are used.  an examination of patil's proof
shows that he has established this claim only under 
strong restrictions on the use of p and v.  these restrictions
eliminate programming techniques used 
by dijkstra and others since the first introduction
of the semaphore concept.  this paper contains a 
solution to the problem.  it also discusses the need
for the generalized operators suggested by patil.

require that storage for a procedure activation 
exist at times when control is not nested within the

three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  these criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  to define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

a correctness proof of a topology information
main tenance protocol for a distributed computer 
network

in order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  one of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  the topology
information protocol that was implemented on the 
merit computer network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  it is based on baran's "hot
potato heuristic routing doctrine."  a correctness 
proof of this topology information protocol is also presented.

event manipulation for discrete simulations
requiring large numbers of events

the event-manipulation system presented here consists of
two major parts.  the first part addresses 
the familiar problem of event scheduling efficiency
when the number of scheduled events grows large. 
 the second part deals with the less apparent problem
of providing efficiency and flexibility as scheduled 
events are accessed to be executed.  additional features
and problems dealt with include the proper handling 
of simultaneous events; that certain events must be created,
scheduled, and executed at the same points 
in simulated time; that infinite loops caused by the concatenation
of such "zero-time" events are possible 
and must be diagnosed; that maintaining various event
counts is practical and economical; and that a 
capability for handling  "time-displaceable" events is desirable and possible.

structured multiprogramming

this paper presents a proposal for structured
representation of multiprogramming in a high 
level language.  the notation used explicitly associates
a data structure shared by concurrent processes 
with operations defined on it.  this clarifies the meaning
of programs and permits a large class of time-dependent 
errors to be caught at compile time.  a combination of
critical regions and event variables enables the 
programmer to control scheduling of resources among
competing processes to any degree desired.  these 
concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only within
operating systems but also within user

 but also within user programs.

capability-based addressing

various addressing schemes making use of segment
tables are examined.  the inadequacies of 
these schemes when dealing with shared addresses are
explained. these inadequacies are traced to the 
lack of an efficient absolute address for objects in
these systems.  the direct use of 
************************
.  the direct use of a capability as 
an address is shown to overcome these difficulties
because it provides the needed absolute address.  
implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed.
 it is predicted that the use of tags to 
identify capabilities will dominate.  a hardware address
translation scheme which never requires the 
modification of the representation of capabilities is
suggested. the scheme uses a main memory hash table 
for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given
its unique code.  the hash table is avoided for
recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative
registers.  a computer using capability-based 
addressing may be substantially superior to present
systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of 
programming conventions, and efficient implementation.

proving termination with multiset orderings

a common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well-founded
set, a set ordered in such a way as to admit no infinite descending sequences.
the basic approach is to find a termination function  that maps
the values of the program variables into some well-founded set,
such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced
throughout the computation.  all too often, the termination functions required 
are difficult to find and are of a complexity out
of proportion to the program under consideration. multisets (bags)
over a given well-founded set s are sets that admit multiple occurrences
of elements
