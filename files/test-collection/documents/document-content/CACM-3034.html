detection of logical errors in decision table programs in this paper an algorithm to detect logical errors in a limited entry decision table and in loop free programs with embedded decision tables is developed all the conditions in the decision tables are assumed to be inequalities or equalities relating linear expressions it is also assumed that actions in a decision table are linear in variables which occur in the condition stub of the decision table or tables to which control is transferred from the table the algorithm is based on determining whether a set of linear inequalities has or does not have a solution the algorithm described in the paper is implemented in fortran iv cacm december 1978 ibramsha m rajaraman v error diagnostics decision tables 3 5 4 1 4 42 5 24 ca781205 dh january 18 1979 4 06 pm 2053 4 3034 2221 4 3034 2273 4 3034 2453 4 3034 2517 4 3034 2517 4 3034 2518 4 3034 2616 4 3034 2616 4 3034 2856 4 3034 3034 4 3034 3034 4 3034 3034 4 3034 1684 5 3034 2053 5 3034 2517 5 3034 3034 5 3034 3034 5 3034 3034 5 3034
