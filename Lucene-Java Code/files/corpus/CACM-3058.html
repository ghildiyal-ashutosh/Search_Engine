jump searching a fast sequential search technique when sequential file structures must be used and binary searching is not feasible jump searching becomes an appealing alternative this paper explores variants of the classic jump searching scheme where the optimum jump size is the square root of the number of records multiple level and variable size jump strategies are explored appropriate applications are discussed and performance is evaluated cacm october 1978 shneiderman b jump searching sequential files file management search strategies database structures index searching 3 74 4 34 ca781003 dh january 29 1979 6 15 pm 3058 4 3058 3063 4 3058 2978 5 3058 3058 5 3058 3058 5 3058 3058 5 3058
