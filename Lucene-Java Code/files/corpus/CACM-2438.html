a model and stack implementation of multiple environments many control and access environment structures require that storage for a procedure activation exist at times when control is not nested within the procedure activated this is straightforward to implement by dynamic storage allocation with linked blocks for each activation but rather expensive in both time and space this paper presents an implementation technique using a single stack to hold procedure activation storage which allows retention of that storage for durations not necessarily tied to control flow the technique has the property that in the simple case it runs identically to the usual automatic stack allocation and deallocation procedure applications of this technique to multitasking coroutines backtracking label valued variables and functional arguments are discussed in the initial model a single real processor is assumed and the implementation assumes multiple processes coordinate by passing control explicitly to one another a multiprocessor implementation requires only a few changes to the basic technique as described cacm october 1973 bobrow d g wegbreit b control structures environments stack allocation dendrarchy retention dynamic storage allocation access environments funarg problem multitasking coroutines backtracking label valued variables functional arguments multiprocessor systems extensible control structures 4 1 4 2 4 22 4 3 4 32 5 24 ca731002 jb january 23 1978 8 27 am 1972 4 2438 2156 4 2438 2168 4 2438 2438 4 2438 2438 4 2438 2723 4 2438 2736 4 2438 2833 4 2438 2855 4 2438 3074 4 2438 3112 4 2438 1826 5 2438 2314 5 2438 2438 5 2438 2438 5 2438 2438 5 2438 2625 5 2438 2922 5 2438 3081 5 2438 3101 5 2438 3112 5 2438 106 6 2438 1380 6 2438 1471 6 2438 1753 6 2438 1826 6 2438 1972 6 2438 2138 6 2438 2193 6 2438 2358 6 2438 2438 6 2438 2438 6 2438 2438 6 2438 2438 6 2438 2438 6 2438 2723 6 2438 2736 6 2438 2833 6 2438 2838 6 2438 3185 6 2438 731 6 2438
