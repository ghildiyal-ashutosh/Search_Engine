algorithm and bound for the greatest common divisor of n integers a new version of the euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of n integers a i and multipliers x i such that gcd x 1 a 1 x n a n is presented the number of arithmetic operations and the number of storage locations are linear in n a theorem of lame that gives a bound for the number of iterations of the euclidean algorithm for two integers is extended to the case of n integers an algorithm to construct a minimal set of multipliers is presented a fortran program for the algorithm appears as comm acm algorithm 386 cacm july 1970 bradley g h greatest common divisor euclidean algorithm number theory diophantine equations 3 15 5 10 ca700706 jb february 13 1978 8 45 am 2031 4 2031 2031 4 2031 1022 5 2031 2028 5 2031 2031 5 2031 2031 5 2031 2031 5 2031 2521 5 2031 450 5 2031 3099 5 2031 1313 6 2031 2028 6 2031 2031 6 2031 2031 6 2031 2031 6 2031 3135 6 2031
