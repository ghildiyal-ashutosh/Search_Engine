symbol manipulation in fortran sasp i subroutines a set of subroutines for use in fortran are described whose purpose is to synthesize output strings from i input strings which have been analyzed by the shadow general syntactic analysis subroutine reported earlier and or ii packed bcd strings formed in any way function type subroutines are included for intermediate manipulations which are performed on the strings which are stored in an abbreviated internal representation the automatic way in which an internal representation for each newly created substring is stored sequentially in a block of common storage and the manner in which a storage block is dynamically allocated for that purpose are discussed cacm june 1964 bailey m j barnett m p burleson p b ca640605 jb march 9 1978 9 43 pm 1051 4 1062 1062 4 1062 1062 4 1062 1121 4 1062 1139 4 1062 1265 4 1062 1781 4 1062 720 4 1062 759 4 1062 1062 5 1062 1062 5 1062 1062 5 1062 1211 5 1062 2902 5 1062 464 5 1062 794 5 1062 1051 6 1062 1051 6 1062 1062 6 1062 1062 6 1062 1184 6 1062 1211 6 1062 1552 6 1062 1879 6 1062 2435 6 1062 2596 6 1062 2734 6 1062 2747 6 1062 2768 6 1062
