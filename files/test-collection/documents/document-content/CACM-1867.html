on the expected lengths of sequences generated in sorting by replacement selecting in the replacement selecting technique of sorting one is interested in the ratio l j of the expected length of the j th sequence generated by the technique to the number of memory cells used using complex variable theory it is shown that l j 2 and that asymptotically the average interval between sign changes of l j 2 is 2 6662 cacm july 1969 hooker w w replacement selecting sorting sequence lengths asymptotic expected length recursion relation generating function meromorphic function 3 74 5 31 ca690713 jb february 15 1978 6 37 pm 1867 4 1867 2272 4 1867 1638 5 1867 1867 5 1867 1867 5 1867 1867 5 1867
