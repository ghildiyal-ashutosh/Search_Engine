analysis of design alternatives for virtual memory indexes

a class of index structures for use in a virtual
memory environment is described.  design alternatives 
within this class of index structures are analyzed.  these
alternatives include a choice of search strategy, 
whether or not pages in the index are structured, and
whether or not keys are compressed.  the average 
cost of retrieving entries from these indexes is expressed
as a wieghted sum of the cost of a basic key 
comparison and the cost of crossing a page boundary in
the index structure.  formulas for the retrieval 
costs for possible 
************************
 
costs for possible combinations of design alternatives
are given.  these are used in numerical case studies 
which compare the retrieval costs of the alternatives.
 qualitative comparisons of the main tenance costs 
(insertion, deletion, reorganization) of the
design alternatives are also included.

a user authentication scheme not requiring secrecy in the computer

in many computer operating systems a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system.  the system compares
this password with one recorded in a password 
table which is available to only the authentication
program.  the integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret.  in this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer.    all aspects of the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  the scheme is based
on using a function h which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  this function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  the intruder may know all about h and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert h to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  this paper discusses

a fast string searching algorithm

an algorithm is presented that searches for
the location, "i," of the first occurrence of a 
character string, "pat," in another string, "string."
 during the search operation, the characters of 
pat are matched starting with the last character of
pat.  the information gained by starting the 
************************
 gained by starting the match 
at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm
to proceed in large jumps through the text being 
searched.  thus the algorithm has the unusual property that,
in most cases, not all of the first i characters 
of string are inspected.  the number of characters actually
inspected (on the average) decreases as a 
function of the length of pat.  for a random english
pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically 
inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at
i.  furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented 
so that (on the average) fewer than i+patlen machine
instructions are executed.  these conclusions are 
supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical
analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm. 
 the worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in
i+patlen, assuming the availability of array space 
for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet.

 to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
it is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 no claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  using the model we answer questions like: 
how many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  what is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  what bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system 
design.

interpolation search -a log logn search

interpolation search is a method of retrieving
a desired record by key in an ordered file by 
using the value of the key and the statistical distribution
of the keys.  it is shown that on the average 
log logn file accesses are required to retrieve a key,
assuming that the n keys are uniformly distributed. 
 the number of extra accesses is also estimated and shown
to be very low.  the same holds if the cumulative 
distribution function of the keys is known.  computational
experiments confirm these results.

and concept case frames; these are used for judging 
meaningfulness of questions, generating dialogue for clarifying
partially understood questions, and resolving 
ellipsis and pronoun reference problems.  other system components
construct a formal query for the relational 
database, and optimize the order of searching relations.
 methods are discussed for handling vague or

optimal decision table conversion has been

technique is quite effective, but its time and 
space requirements are independent of how "easy" the

to produce good, quasi optimal solutions.  the branch-and-bound
technique uses a good heuristic to direct 
the search, but is cluttered up

space, since the number of solutions increases 
with the number of test variables according to a double 
exponential.  in this paper we suggest a heuristically 
guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic
programming, recognizes identical subproblems but 
which can be used to find both optimal and quasi optimal
solutions.  the heuristic search method introduced 
in this paper combines the positive aspects of the above
two techniques.  compressed tables with a large 
number of variables can be handled without deriving expanded tables first.

detail.  the system is written in lisp 1.5 and operates on the q-32
time-sharing system.  the system's data structures and their semantic
organization, the deductive question-answering formalism of
relational properties and complex-relation-forming operators, and
the question-answering procedures which employ these features in
their operation are all described and illustrated.  examples of the
system's performance and of the limitations of its question-answering 
capability are presented and discussed.  it is shown that the
use of semantic information in deductive question answering greatly 
facilitates the process, and that a top-down procedure which works
from question to answer enables effective use to be made of this
information.  it is concluded that the development of protosynthex
iii into a practically useful system to work with large data
bases is possible but will require changes in both the data

the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications system

a study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system.  it is
concluded that while, for certain values of system 
parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer (model), in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance.  analytical and simulation results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an m/d/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem
with a single exponential server (the computer).

median split trees: a fast lookup technique for frequently occuring keys

split trees are a new technique for searching sets
of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions. 
 a split tree is a binary search tree each node of which
contains two key values-a node value which is 
a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split
value which partitions the remaining keys (with 
respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and
right subtrees.  a median split tree (mst) uses 
the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split
value to force the search tree to be perfectly 
balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation
of the tree and high search speed.  unlike 
frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a
successful search of an mst is log n bounded and 
very stable around minimal values.  further, an mst
can be built for a given key ordering and set of 
frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n2 for an
optimum binary search tree.  a discussion of the 
application of mst's to dictionary lookup for english is
presented, and the performance obtained is contrasted 
with that of other techniques.

time-sharing systems, as defined in this article,
are those multiaccess systems which permit 
a terminal user to utilize essentially the full resources
of the system while sharing its time with other 
terminal users.  it is each terminal user's ability
to utilize the full resources of the system that 
makes quantitative evaluation of time-sharing systems
particularly difficult.  six criteria are described 
which have been successfully used to perform first-level

automatic derivation of microsentences

the decomposition of long complex english sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  to explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the harvard multipath analysis program.  the basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  a program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 the authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems, they may have practical

is discussed within the context of an interpretive 
processing environment controlled by the use of procedural
directives.  the sequence of procedural directives 
is derived from a job assumed to be expressed in a user-oriented

the structured data environment (data bank) is explicitly
or implicitly related to a format declaration
residing in a format library.  the processing mechanics
associated with data string manipulation is developed 
in accordance with a generalized data filtering concept.
 this results in the implementation of a two-part 
data filter module that satisfies internal processing
functions by filtering data strings through format

canonical structure in attribute based file organization

a new file structure for attribute based retrieval
is proposed in this paper.  it allows queries 
involving arbitrary boolean functions of the attribute-value
pairs to be processed without taking intersections 
of lists.  the structure is highly dependent on the
way in which the file is to be used and is uniquely 
determined by the specification of the allowed queries.
 thus, for example, the structure for retrieval 
on the basis of ranges of values of a given attribute would
be very different from one where only retrieval 
on the basis of a single value is permitted.  the file
organization being proposed is based on the atoms 
of a boolean algebra generated by the queries.  the desirable
properties claimed for this structure are 
proved, and file maintenance questions are discussed.

multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searching

this paper develops the multidimensional binary
search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality 
of the search space) as a data structure for storage of
information to be retrieved by associative searches. 
the k-d tree is defined and examples are given. it
is shown to be quite in its storage requirements. 
 a significant advantage of this structure is that a single
data structure can handle many types of queries 
very efficiently.  various utility algorithms are developed;
their proven average running times in an 
n record file are: insertion, o (log n); deletion of
the root, o (n^(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, 
o (log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance
of searches), o (n log n).  search algorithms 
are given for partial match queries with t keys specified
[proven maximum running time of o (n^(k-t)/k)] 
and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average
running time of o (log n).]  these performances 
far surpass the best currently known algorithms for
these tasks.  an algorithm is presented to handle 
any general intersection query. the main focus of this

the conversion of limited-entry decision tables
to optimal and near-optimal flowcharts: two new 
algorithms

two new algorithms for deriving optimal and
near-optimal flowcharts from limited entry decision 
tables are presented.  both take into account rule frequencies
and the time needed to test conditions. 
 one of the algorithms, called the optimum-finding algorithm,
leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes 
execution time for a decision table in which simple rules
are already contracted to complex rules.  the 
other one, called the optimum-approaching algorithm, requires
many fewer calculations but does not necessarily 
produce the optimum flowchart.  the algorithms are first
derived for treating decision tables not containing 
an else-rule, but the optimum-approaching algorithm
is shown to be equally valid for tables including 
such a rule.  both algorithms are compared with existing
ones and are applied to a somewhat large decision 
table derived from a real case.  from this comparison two
conclusions are drawn.  (1) the optimum-approaching 
algorithm will usually lead to better results than comparable
existing ones and will not require more, 
but usually less, computation time.(2) in general, the
greater computation effort needed for applying 
the optimum-finding algorithm will not be justified
by the small reduction in execution time obtained.

paramount in the provision of information services:

direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  the first contribution

relating primarily to early research on compilers.  these
documents have been cataloged and indexed and

general performance analysis of key-to-address

this paper presents a new approach to the analysis
of performance of the various key-to-address 
transformation methods.  in this approach the keys in
a file are assumed to have been selected from the 
key space according to a certain probabilistic selection
algorithm.  all files with the same number of 
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance with the algorithm, and the 
average performance of the transformation methods on
these files will be used as the potential of these 
methods.  using this analysis, methods with the same overall
performance can be classified and key distributions 
partial to certain transformations can be identified.
 all this can be done analytically.  the approach 
is applied to a group of transformation methods
using files whose keys are selected randomly.

sitar: an interactive text processing system for small computers

sitar, a low-cost in teractive text handling
and text analysis system for nontechnical users, 
is in many ways comparable to in teractive bibliographical
search and retrieval systems, but has several 
************************
 systems, but has several 
additional features. it is implemented on a pdp/11 time-sharing
computer invoked by a crt with microprogrammed 
editing functions.  it uses a simple command language designating
a function, a file, and a search template 
consisting of the textual string desired and strings
delimiting the context in which the hit is to be 
delivered.  extensive experience with sitar shows that
the combined powers of simple commands, string 
orientation, circular file structure, a crt with local
memory, and conversational computing produce a 
system much more powerful than the sum of its parts.

 this method treats text as a string of characters rather
than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  the members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.
the rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages.

a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  the use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  in this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

device for the class of grammars which

a set which can be exhaustively and exclusively 
generated by a grammar.  based upon the rules of this grammar,
a sentence recognizer will evaluate sentences, 
questions in the normal situation.  since the recognition
function succeeds just in case the posed question 
is drawn from the set of sentences expressing the data,

detection of three-dimensional patterns of atoms in chemical structures

an algorithm for detecting occurrences of a three-dimensional pattern of
objects within a larger structure is presented.  the search technique

characteristics demanded of candidates for matching. this is useful
in cases where the properties of each atom, considered individually,
do not adequately limit the number of sets of possible matchings.
several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry
are: (1) in pharmacology: searching for a common constellation
of atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities;
(2) in x-ray crystallography: fitting a structure or a structural fragment
to a set of peaks in the electron-density distribution of
a fourier map; (3) in chemical documentation; retrieving from

use either as a pedagogical device or for

large lp problems would doubtless benefit from

input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentation
