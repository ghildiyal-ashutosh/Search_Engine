some basic determinants of computer programming productivity

the propose of this research was to examine
the relationship between processing characteristics 
of programs and experience characteristics of programmers
and program development time.  the ultimate 
objective was to develop a technique for predicting
the amount of time necessary to create a computer 
program.  the fifteen program characteristics hypothesized
as being associated with an increase in programming 
time required are objectively measurable from preprogramming
specifications.  the five programmer characteristics 
are experience-related and are also measurable before a programming
task is begun.  nine program characteristics 
emerged as major influences on program development time,
each associated with increased program development 
time.  all five programmer characteristics were found
to be related to reduced program development time. 
 a multiple regression  equation which contained one programmer
characteristic and four program characteristics 
gave evidence of good predictive power for
forecasting program development time.

texture and reflection in computer generated images

in 1974 catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. 
 this paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
************************
tion and lighting models. 
 the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  the intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. the shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  the patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 the amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  several examples of images synthesized 
using these new techniques are included.

on the optimization of performance of time-sharing systems by simulation

a simulation model 
************************
tion

a simulation model of a time-sharing system
with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite 
auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system
parameters such as store size, number of jobs 
allowed to execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm,
etc.  the effects of these variations on 
a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which
of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  system performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 it is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the

the optimum round-robin cycle time.  it appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm

manner and would not benefit from optimization.  features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads,

is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  the comparison 
is found to be very favorable.

the synthesis of loop predicates

current methods for mechanical program verification
require a complete predicate specification 
on each loop.  because this is tedious and error prone,
producing a program with complete, correct predicates 
is reasonably difficult and would be facilitated by machine
assistance.  this paper discusses techniques 
for mechanically synthesizing loop predicates.  two classes
of techniques are

methods which derive loop predicates from boundary conditions
and/or partially specified inductive assertions: 
(2) extraction methods which use input predicates and

interval arithmetic determinant evaluation
and its use in testing for a chebyshev system

two recent papers, one by hansen and one by
hansen and r. r. smith, have shown how interval 
arithmetic (i.) can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations.  in the present paper 
a method proposed by hasen and r. r. smith is compared
with straightforward use of i. in determinant 
evaluation.  computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
i. for determinant evaluation.  an application using
i. determinants in a program to test a set of 
functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented.

experiments in automatic learning for a multipurpose heuristic program

an automatic learning capability has been developed
and implemented for use with the multiple 
(multipurpose program that learns) heuristic tree-searching
program, which is presently being applied 
to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus.
multiple's proving program (pp) uses two evaluation 
functions to guide its search for a proof of whether
or not a particular goal is achievable.

general features of predicate calculus clauses were created
for use in the automatic learning of better 
evaluation functions for pp.  a 
************************
 functions for pp.  a multiple regression
program was used to produce optimal coefficients 
for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features.
 also, automatic data-handling routines were 
written for passing data between the learning program
and the proving program, and for analyzing and 
summarizing results.  data was generally collected for
learning (regression analysis) from the experience 
of pp.  a number of experiments were performed to test
the effectiveness and generality of the learning 
program. results showed that the learning produced dramatic
improvements in the solutions to problems 
which were in the same domain as those used for collection
learning data.  learning was also shown to 
generalize successfully to domains other than those used
for data collection.  another experiment demonstrated 
that the learning program could simultaneously improve
performance on problems in a specific domain and 
on problems in a variety of domains.  some variations
of the learning program were also tested.

operating system performance

an overview of the current and future positions
with respect to operating system performance 
is given.  while a great deal of information and a large
number of models for subsystems have been developed, 
gaps still exist in out knowledge.  because of the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
of an operating system, an overall model of the total
system must be developed to be able to analyze 
and design the performance aspects of an operating system
although such total system designs are exceptional 
today, it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common and necessary in the near future. 
 such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact
on the way we go about modularizing operating 
and computer systems.

an application of heuristic search methods to edge and contour detection

this paper presents a method for detecting edges
and contours in noisy pictures.  the properties 
of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge
detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing 
the given figure of merit.  this problem can be represented
as a shortest path problem on a graph and 
can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms.
 the relations between this representation of 
the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach
are discussed, showing that the graph search 
method can lead to substantial improvements in computing
time.  moreover, if heuristic search methods 
are used, the computing time will depend on the amount
of noise in the picture.  some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the separation 
of touching objects.

some new methods of detecting step edges in digital pictures

this note describes two operators that respond
to step edges, but not to ramps.  the first 
is similar to the digital laplacian, but uses the max, rather
than the sum, of the x and y second differences. 
 the second uses the difference between the mean and
median gray levels in a neighborhood.  the outputs 
obtained from these operators applied to a set of test
pictures are compared with each other and with 
the standard digital laplacian and gradient.  a third
operator, which uses the distance between the center 
and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value, is also
briefly considered; it turns out to be equivalent 
to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient.

ethernet: distributed packet switching for local computer networks

ethernet is a branching broadcast communication
system for carrying digital data packets among 
locally distributed computing stations. the packet
transport mechanism provided by ethernet has been 
used to build systems which can be viewed as either local
computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. 
 an ethernet's shared communication facility, its ether,
is a passive broadcast medium with no central 
control.  coordination of access to the ether for packet
broadcasts is distributed among the contending 
transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration.

to its difficulty and prohibitive cost. this paper
discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval 
system which has the effect of significantly reducing
the cost of experimentation and enabling research 
never attempted before.  the model is designed to estimate
the retrieval workload of alternative data 
retrieval systems.  these data retrieval systems can
be organized under several database organizations, 
including inverted list, threaded list, and cellular
list organizations and hybrid combinations of these 
systems.  effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated
by using the model to study the effect of 
database organizations in data retrieval systems.  in particular,

hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have

are: (1) in pharmacology: searching for a common constellation

point of an edge are found.  the computing time

productivity of multiprogrammed computers-progress
in developing an analytic prediction method

multiprogramming as it is discussed here is
a mode of computer operation in which two or more
programs are concurrently in processor memory and proceeding,
each using the same central processor unit 
(cpu) and input-output (i/o) channels.  these programs
are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, 
according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority.
 it is useful to be able to represent them 
as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each
at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of 
that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other
programs.  the effective progress rate of each 
program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics
of itself and its co-residents and simulation has 
been the best available method of predicting it.  this
paper presents the results of progress in developing 
an alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative
computation of these rates under certain 
situations.  the algorithm is sensitive to most of the
factors that control the phenomenon, including 
nonquantitative or topological features of the programs' structures.

language analysis in the humanities

the use of the computer in the language-oriented
humanities for exhaustive listing of detail 
(as in indices and concordances) is widespread and accepted
as desirable.  the implications of the computer 
for a "science" of the humanities-a science entailing
gathering data for the construction and testing 
of models-are neither widely recognized nor accepted.
 this paper argues that the computer's  major role 
as to language analysis in the humanities will be the
establishing of such a sciencehus, for those 
areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision
are necessary (e.g. analyzing literature or teaching 
a student to write a composition) the computer
can be a critically important facilitator.

the cyclic order property of vertices as an aid in scene analysis

a cyclic-order property is defined for bodies bounded by smooth-curved faces.
the property is shown to be useful for analyzing pictures of such bodies,
particularly when the line data extracted from the pictures are imperfect.
this property augments previously known grammatical rules that
determine the existence of three-dimensional bodies corresponding
to given two-dimensional line-structure data.

theoretical considerations in information retrieval systems

information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  for identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by goffman, verhoeff and belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  for searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  the inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  one is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a

improving the access time for random access files

clustering in the key set is decreased by
smoothing the key-to-address transformation, and 
by adding shadow buckets to an open chaining file.  the
keys are pre-hashed before the address division, 
to remove the effect of sequential properties in the
key set.  shadow buckets in the key search sequence 
reduce the effect of nonuniformity in file loading,
and decrease the number of maximum probes needed 
to locate a record.  the combined effects of these techniques
lead to improved file performance for secondary 
storage

analyses of english sentences with respect 
to a transformational grammar.  the main features of the
analyzer are that it uses only a limited dictionary 
of english words and that it pursues all analysis paths
simultaneously while processing the sentence 
from left to right.  the form of representation used
for the dictionary and the grammar is indicated 
and an outline account is given of the analysis procedure.
 techniques for keeping the size of the analysis 
record within reasonable limits and for avoiding the need

performance monitoring in a time-sharing system

a software measurement facility which is part of
a general purpose time-sharing system is described. 
 the date collection facility (dcf) has been implemented
in the michigan terminal system (mts) for the 
system/360 model 67.  it exists for the purpose of monitoring
operating system and user program behavior 
and performance.  the overall structure of mts is outlined
in order to explain the implementation of 
the dcf.  events in the system are identified and recorded
from within the supervisor, and dumped to 
magnetic tape by an auxiliary program for off-line processing.
 events in user programs which are unrelated 
to system actions are recorded with a supervisor call.
 the time of occurrence of each event is accurately 
recorded, and data items are further identified by job and
type.  the overhead associated with data collection 
and its interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed,
and both are shown to be minimal.  several 
examples are given of information obtained with the
facility and of applications in which it has been 
useful.  some general guidelines are offered for
the construction of future monitoring programs.

detection of combined occurrences

in this paper it is supposed that the variables
x1,...,xn each have finite range with the variable 
xi taking on pi possible values and that the values of the
variables are changing with time.  it is supposed 
further that it is desired to detect occurrences in which
some subset of the variables achieve particular 
values.  finally, it is supposed that the problem involves
the detection of a large number of combined 
occurrences for a large number of changes of values of
variables.  two efficient solutions for this problem 
are described.  both methods have the unusual property
of being faster for systems where the sum p1 + ... 
+ pn is larger. the first solution is error-free
and suitable for most cases.  the second solution 
is slightly more elegant and allows negation as well
as conjunction, but is subject to the possibility 
of errors.  an error analysis is given for the second
method and an empirical study is reported.

it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions
of alternate widths.  all widths are calculated 
for an illustrative example; graphical and tabular comparisons

magnitude is found.  the principal conclusion is that
the set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern
