some basic determinants of computer programming productivity

the propose of this research was to examine
the relationship between processing characteristics 
of programs and experience characteristics of programmers
and program development time.  the ultimate 
objective was to develop a technique for predicting
the amount of time necessary to create a computer 
program.  the fifteen program characteristics hypothesized
as being associated with an increase in programming 
time required are objectively measurable from preprogramming
specifications.  the five programmer characteristics 
are experience-related and are also measurable before a programming
task is begun.  nine program characteristics 
emerged as major influences on program development time,
each associated with increased program development 
time.  all five programmer characteristics were found
to be related to reduced program development time. 
 a multiple regression  equation which contained one programmer
characteristic and four program characteristics 
gave evidence of good predictive power for
forecasting program development time.

on the optimization of performance of time-sharing systems by simulation

a simulation 
************************
 by simulation

a simulation model of a time-sharing system
with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite 
auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system
parameters such as store size, number of jobs 
allowed to execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm,
etc.  the effects of these variations on 
a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which
of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  system performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 it is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  it appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm
affect system performance in a predictable 
manner and would not benefit from optimization.  features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, 
the size of the store, and the speed of the cpu.  a comparison
is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  the comparison

interval arithmetic determinant evaluation
and its use in testing for a chebyshev system

two recent papers, one by hansen and one by
hansen and r. r. smith, have shown how interval 
arithmetic (i.) can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations.  in the present paper 
a method proposed by hasen and r. r. smith is compared
with straightforward use of i. in determinant 
evaluation.  computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
i. for determinant evaluation.  an application using
i. determinants in a program to test a set of 
functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented.

expanding the editing function in language data processing

in automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  applications are described,
such processes as factor analysis.  applications

experiments in automatic learning for a multipurpose heuristic program

an automatic learning capability has been developed
and implemented for use with the multiple 
(multipurpose program that learns) heuristic tree-searching
program, which is presently being applied 
to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus.
multiple's proving program (pp) uses two evaluation 
functions to guide its search for a proof of whether
or not a particular goal is achievable.  thirteen 
general features of predicate calculus clauses were created
for use in the automatic learning of better 
evaluation functions for pp.  a multiple regression
program was used to produce optimal coefficients 
for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features.
 also, automatic data-handling routines were 
written for passing data between the learning program
and the proving program, and for analyzing and 
summarizing results.  data was generally collected for
learning (regression analysis) from the experience 
of pp.  a number of experiments were performed to test
the effectiveness and generality of the learning 
program. results showed that the learning produced dramatic
improvements in the solutions to problems 
which were in the same domain as those used for collection
learning data.  learning was also shown to 
generalize successfully to domains other than those used
for data collection.  another experiment demonstrated 
that the learning program could simultaneously improve
performance on problems in a specific

of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a

generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared

operating system performance

an overview of the current and future positions
with respect to operating system performance 
is given.  while a great deal of information and a large
number of models for subsystems have been developed, 
gaps still exist in out knowledge.  because of the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
of an operating system, an overall model of the total
system must be developed to be able to analyze 
and design the performance aspects of an operating system
although such total system designs are exceptional 
today, it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common and necessary in the near future. 
 such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact
on the way we go about modularizing operating 
and computer systems.

a phonological rule tester

the design and implementation of a system to

linguist in the area of phonology are presented.  it
permits the user to define, on-line, sets of rules 
statable within the framework presented in the sound
patterns of english by chomsky and halle, 1968, 
to define phonemes as bundles of specified distinctive
features, to define data as strings of phonemes 
with associated grammatical structure, to test the effect
of applying rules to the data, and to store 
both the definitions and results.  the rule application
facility described in detail was implemented 
by translating linguistic rules to rules in flip, a
format-directed list processor embedded in lisp. 
 this made the system construction easy while providing
sophisticated capabilities for the linguist. 
 the system is written in bbn lisp on the scientific
data system 940 computer and is designed to be used 
on-line in interactive fashion, with control returned
to the user after each command is executed.

a software design and evaluation system

a critical failure of current software system
design and implementation methodology is that 
the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented.  in this paper 
the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed.  a system which integrates performance evaluation
with design and implementation is described. 
 this system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  the source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines.  using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at 
************************
 sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications system

a study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system.  it is
concluded that while, for certain values of system 
parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer (model), in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance.  analytical and simulation results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an m/d/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem
with a single exponential server (the computer). 
 analytical results include a general description of the
output process of an m/d/1 queue and the conditions 
under which this output process is approximately poisson.

automatic derivation of microsentences

the decomposition of long complex english sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  to explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer

ethernet: distributed packet switching for local computer networks

ethernet is a branching broadcast communication
system for carrying digital data packets among 
locally distributed computing stations. the packet
transport mechanism provided by ethernet has been 
used to build systems which can be viewed as either local
computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. 
 an ethernet's shared communication facility, its ether,
is a passive broadcast medium with no central 
control.  coordination of access to the ether for packet
broadcasts is distributed among the contending 
transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration.
 switching of packets to their destinations 
on the ether is distributed among the receiving stations
using packet address recognition.  design principles 
and implementation are described, based on experience
with an operating ethernet of 100 nodes along a 
kilometer of coaxial cable.  a model for estimating performance

************************


experimental work in the valuation of large
scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due 
to its difficulty and prohibitive cost. this paper
discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval 
system which has the effect of significantly reducing
the cost of experimentation and enabling research 
never attempted before.  the model is designed to estimate
the retrieval workload of alternative data 
retrieval systems.  these data retrieval systems can
be organized under several database organizations, 
including inverted list, threaded list, and cellular
list organizations and hybrid combinations of these 
systems.  effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated
by using the model to study the effect of 
database organizations in data retrieval systems.  in particular,
the impact of query complexity is analyzed.

of sorting procedures in the context of the dynamic paging
environment characteristic of virtual memory machines.  descriptions of 
the experimental sort programs and analysis of the performance
measurement results obtained for them are presented. the insight gained 
from the experimental effort is used to arrive at a set of

the smart automatic document retrieval system-an illustration

a fully automatic document retrieval system
operating on the ibm 7094 is described.  the system 
is characterized by the fact that several hundred different
methods are available to analyze documents 
and search requests.  this feature is used in the retrieval
process by leaving the exact sequence of 
operations initially unspecified, and adapting the
search strategy to the needs of individual users. 
 the system is used not only to simulate an actual operating
environment, but also to test the effectiveness 
of the various available processing methods.  results obtained
so far seem to indicate that some combination 
of analysis procedures can in general be relied upon to
retrieve the wanted information.  a typical search

characterized the distributions underlying an elementary

a simple linear model of demand paging performance

predicting the performance of a proposed automatically
managed multilevel memory system requires 
a model of the patterns by which programs refer to the
information stored in the memory.  some recent 
experimental measurements on the multics virtual memory
suggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably 
simple program reference model will suffice.  the simple
model combines the effect of the information 
reference pattern with the effect of the automatic management
algorithm to produce a single, composite 
statement: the mean number of memory references between
paging exceptions increases linearly with the 
size of the paging memory.  the resulting model is easy
to manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse 
problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory,
arranging for reproducible memory usage charges, 
and estimating the amount of core memory sharing.

productivity of multiprogrammed computers-progress
in developing an analytic prediction method

multiprogramming as it is discussed here is
a mode of computer operation in which two or more
programs are concurrently in processor memory and proceeding,
each using the same central processor unit 
(cpu) and input-output (i/o) channels.  these programs
are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, 
according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority.
 it is useful to be able to represent them 
as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each
at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of 
that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other
programs.  the effective progress rate of each 
program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics
of itself and its co-residents and simulation has 
been the best available method of predicting it.  this
paper presents the results of progress in developing 
an alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative
computation of these rates under certain 
situations.  the algorithm is sensitive to most of the
factors that control the phenomenon, including 
nonquantitative or topological features of the programs' structures.

clocks and data channels, general purpose programmed probing
and recording tools, and specialized measurement facilities.  some
particular measurements of interest in a system which combines demand 
paging with multiprogramming are described in detail.  where appropriate, 
insight into effectiveness (or lack there of) of individual tools is provided.

interference in multiprocessor computer systems with interleaved memory

************************
 with interleaved memory

this paper analyzes the memory interference
caused by several processors simultaneously using 
several memory modules.  exect results are computed for
a simple model of such a system.   the limiting 
value is derived for the relative degree of memory interference
as the system size increases.  the model 
of the limiting behavior of the system yields approximate
results for the simple model and also suggests 
that the results are valid for a much larger class of models,
including those more nearly like real systems 
that the simple model are tested against some measurements
of program behavior and simulations of systems 
using memory references from real programs.  the model
results provide a good indication of the performance 
that should be expected

theoretical considerations in information retrieval systems

information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  for identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by goffman, verhoeff and belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  for searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  the inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  one is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a

results are summarized from an empirical study
directed at the measurement of program operating 
behavior in those multiprogramming systems in which
programs are organized into fixed length pages.  
the data collected from the interpretive execution of
a number of paged programs are used to describe 
the frequency of page faults, i.e. the frequency of those
instants at which an executing program requires 
a page of data or instructions not in main (core) memory.
 these data are used also for the evaluation 
of page replacement algorithms and for assessing the

three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability,

imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content

processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems,

performance monitoring in a time-sharing system

a software measurement facility which is part of
a general purpose time-sharing system is described. 
 the date collection facility (dcf) has been implemented
in the michigan terminal system (mts) for the 
system/360 model 67.  it exists for the purpose of monitoring
operating system and user program behavior 
and performance.  the overall structure of mts is outlined
in order to explain the implementation of 
the dcf.  events in the system are identified and recorded
from within the supervisor, and dumped to 
magnetic tape by an auxiliary program for off-line processing.
 events in user programs which are unrelated 
to system actions are recorded with a supervisor call.
 the time of occurrence of each event is accurately 
recorded, and data items are further identified by job and
type.  the overhead associated with data collection 
and its interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed,
and both are shown to be minimal.  several 
examples are given of information obtained with the
facility and of applications in which it has been 
useful.  some general guidelines are offered for
the construction of future monitoring programs.
