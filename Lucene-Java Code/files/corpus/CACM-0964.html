mechanization of tedious algebra the e coefficients of theoretical chemistry a table of formulas for certain integrals involving legendre functions has been constructed mechanically by a program which performed algebraic operations the formulas are all rational algebraic expressions in a single variable and were constructed by a recurrence procedure they are of interest in molecular quantum chemistry trivial coding techniques were used to write the relevant programs in fortran the results were photo composed on a photon s 560 system that was controlled by tapes which were punched directly from the computer output so avoiding manual keyboarding transcription errors and keyboarded correction cacm december 1964 wactlar h d barnett m p ca641207 jb march 9 1978 3 38 pm 1028 4 964 1121 4 964 1216 4 964 1392 4 964 1396 4 964 1396 4 964 659 4 964 964 4 964 964 4 964 964 4 964 964 5 964 964 5 964 964 5 964 1334 5 964 1396 5 964 284 5 964 1444 5 964 561 5 964 759 5 964 964 6 964 964 6 964 964 6 964 1028 6 964 1029 6 964 1083 6 964 1132 6 964 1214 6 964 1278 6 964 1334 6 964 1365 6 964 1386 6 964 1387 6 964 1388 6 964 1392 6 964 1393 6 964 1394 6 964 1395 6 964 1396 6 964 1397 6 964 1496 6 964 284 6 964 407 6 964 3199 6 964 3200 6 964 3201 6 964 3202 6 964 3203 6 964 3204 6 964 561 6 964 730 6 964
