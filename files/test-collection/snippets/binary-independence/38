the next 700 programming languages 

a family of unimplemented computing languages
is described that is intended to span differences 
of application area by a unified framework.  this framework
dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined 
names, and the conventions about characterizing functional
relationships.  within this framework the 
design of a specific language splits into two independent
parts.  one is the choice of written appearances 
of programs (or more generally, their physical representation).
 the other is the choice of the abstract 
entities (such as numbers,

pufft-the purdue university fast fortran translator

a core resident, compile-and-go system designed
for the ibm 7090/7094 computer is described. 
 in little more than half of the 32k word core memory
pufft provides a monitor for job sequencing, a 
translator for the full fortran iv language, the fortran
subroutine library, an input--output system 
for use at compile time and at execute time, and a rather
elaborate diagnostic message writing routine. 
 batches of small- and medium-sized fortran iv source
language programs are processed at very high speeds. 
 language compatibility has been maintained so that
programs may be debugged in the pufft system and 
then recompiled and run in the ibjob-ibftc system supplied by the manufacturer.

recursive data structures in apl

a mathematical study of three approaches for defining nested
arrays in apl is presented.  theorems exhibiting the relationships
between the definitional systems are given and illustrated through graph
representations.  one of the approaches is used to define an
apl array to be a recursive data structure equivalent to a tree structure
in which all data is stored at the leaves as homogeneous
arrays of numbers and characters.  an extension of apl is proposed that
includes new primitive functions to manipulate the nesting
level of arrays and new operators to assist in the
construction

convert

a programming language is described which
is applicable to problems conveniently described 
by transformation rules.  by this is meant that patterns
may be prescribed, each being associated with 
a skeleton, so that a series of such pairs may be searched
until a pattern is found which matches an 
expression to be transformed.  the conditions for a match
are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions 
to be identified and eventually substituted into the
corresponding skeleton.  the primitive patterns 
and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the
principle which allow their elaboration in to more 
complicated patterns and skeletons.  the advantages of the
language are that it allows one to apply transformation 
rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that both
patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively, 
and that

the denotational semantics of programming languages

this paper is a tutorial introduction to the
theory of programming language semantics developed 
by d. scott and c. strachey.  the application of the theory
to formal language specification is demonstrated 
and other applications are surveyed. the first language
considered, loop, is very elementary and its

in the first part of the paper, flow diagrams
are introduced to represent inter al. mappings 
of a set into itself.  although not every diagram is
decomposable into a finite number of given base 
diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due
to a suitable extension of the given set and of 
the basic mappings defined in it.  two normalization

the treatment of data types in el1

in constructing a general purpose programming
language, a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set of data types and associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
and efficient implementation.  the el1 language contains
a number of features specifically designed to 
simultaneously satisfy both requirements.  the resulting
treatment of data types includes provision for 
programmer-defined data types data types and generic
routines, programmer control over type conversion, 
and very flexible data type behavior, in a context that
allows efficient compiled code and compact data 
representation.

a record and file partitioning model

one of the main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  this paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable
length data-items.  the probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
the file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  one of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  the model that is presented in 
this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and
a mixed integer programming model, is a very general 
one; several types of file systems may

the structure of programming languages

in this paper the major components of every
programming language are identified as: (1) the 
elementary program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking
elementary statements together, (3) the means 
by which a program

s 
by which a program can obtain data inputs.  several
alternative forms of each of these components are 
also described, compared and evaluated.  many examples,
frequently from list processing languages, illustrate 
the forms 
************************
, illustrate 
the forms described.  the advantages, disadvantages and
factors influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language are discussed, and the paper concludes
with the suggestion that programming languages 
evolve toward one which will permit all the most convenient
ways of structuring programs, organizing 
systems and referencing data.
