on simulating networks of parallel processes in which simultaneous events may occur some of the problems of simulating discrete event systems particularly computer systems on a conventional digital computer are dealt with the systems are assumed to be described as a network of interconnected sequential processes briefly reviewed are the common techniques used to handle such simulations when simultaneous events do not occur can be ignored or can be handled by simple priority rules following this the problem of dealing with simultaneous events in separate processes is introduced an abstraction of this problem is developed which admits solution for a majority of commonly encountered problems the technique will either find a method of simulating the parallel events or report that none can be found in some of the latter cases it is shown to be possible to find a solution by extending the information available to the solution technique but in many cases the technique becomes computationally unfeasible when the additional information is provided cacm september 1969 parnas d l simulation parallel processes simultaneous events picture processing computer system simulation 3 19 3 24 4 24 5 9 6 9 ca690910 jb february 15 1978 4 21 pm 1541 4 1846 1805 4 1846 1846 4 1846 1846 4 1846 1846 4 1846 1846 4 1846 1846 4 1846 1892 4 1846 2060 4 1846 2188 4 1846 2218 4 1846 2218 4 1846 2317 4 1846 2630 4 1846 2650 4 1846 3112 4 1846 1380 5 1846 1424 5 1846 1484 5 1846 1572 5 1846 1846 5 1846 1846 5 1846 1846 5 1846 576 5 1846 3064 5 1846 1846 6 1846 1939 6 1846 2742 6 1846 2767 6 1846 2936 6 1846
