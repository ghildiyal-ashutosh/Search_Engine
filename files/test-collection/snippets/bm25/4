a user authentication scheme not requiring secrecy in the computer

in many computer operating systems a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system.  the system compares
this password with one recorded in a password 
table which is available to only the authentication
program.  the integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret.  in this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer.    all aspects of the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  the scheme is based
on using a function h which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  this function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  the intruder may know all about h and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert h to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  this paper discusses
issues surrounding selection of a suitable h.  two 
different plausible arguments are given that penetration
would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then 
argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.  finally,

the state of computer oriented curricula in business schools 1970

the acm committee on computer education for management,
supported by a national science foundation 
grant, is established to appraise the state of the art
and to develop a series of recommendations for 
improving computer education for management.  to provide
the committee with material for its study of 
curricular needs, five regional meetings in the united
states were held in 1970, at each of which a broad 
cross section of invited academicians and practitioners
considered the state of curricula in business 
schools.  three topics were covered: curricula for
the general manager; computer-related material in 
required and functional courses; and curricula for students
concentrating on computer-based information 
systems.  an analysis of the minutes of the meetings
revealed a common set of experiences which raised 
similar pedagogic and economic issues.  this presentation
gives a summary of the discussions; a condensation
of the pedagogic and substantive concerns raised; and
consideration of the resource allocation issues 
involved.  preliminary to the committee's recommendations
for improving computer education for management, 
this report has been prepared to provide the participants
and the administrators of their institutions 
with background information for the ongoing task of course
development.  chairman of the ten-man committee 
is daniel teichroew (the university of michigan).

coko iii: the cooper-koz chess program

coko iii is a chess player written entirely
in fortran.  on the ibm 360-65, coko iii plays 
a minimal chess game at the rate of .2 sec cpu time
per move, with a level close to lower chess club 
play.  a selective tree searching procedure controlled
by tactical chess logistics allows a deployment 
of multiple minimal game calculations to achieve some optimal
move selection.  the tree searching algorithms 
are the heart of coko's effectiveness, yet they are
conceptually simple.  in addition, an interesting 
phenomenon called a tree searching catastrophe has plagued
coko's entire development just as it troubles 
a human player.  standard exponential growth is curbed
to a large extent by the definition and trimming 
of the fischer set.  a clear distinction between tree
pruning and selective tree searching is also made. 
 representation of the chess environment is described
along with a strategical preanalysis procedure 
that maps the lasker regions.  specific chess algorithms
are described which could be used as a command

expanding the editing function in language data processing

in automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  applications are described,
such processes as factor analysis.  applications

unconventional decomposition, if implemented with 
the conventional assumption that a module consists of
one or more subroutines, will be less efficient 
in most cases.  an alternative approach to implementation
which does not have this effect is sketched.

a statistical model for console behavior in multiuser computers

the ability of a computer system to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
it is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 no claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  using the model we answer questions like: 
how many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  what is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  what bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system 
design.

effective information retrieval using term accuracy

externally) of what is proposed; (2) project and perhaps
wait for changes in complementary techniques;

(4) establish the existence of demand for 
what is proposed; (5) take steps to involve a representative

and (6) carefully think through possible side effects

of an information utility in a prototype 
community or the acceptance of a policy in
favor of its widespread implementation.

database abstractions: aggregation

aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction
which is important in conceptualizing the real 
world.  aggregation transforms a relationship between
objects into a higher-level object.  a new data 
type, called aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies 
aggregation abstractions.  relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  to main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  it 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  a top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  it is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail, should be incorporated

a simple user-oriented compiler source language
for programming automatic test equipment

for the nonprogrammer, difficulty in using
a language increases rapidly with the number of 
nonproblem-oriented conventions.  a simple language, even
if inelegant, which considers the user's background 
as part of the problem may be more effective than a source
language containing subtle and more powerful 
capabilities.  the language described in this paper is
used to write computer programs which test electronic 
equipment.  because this testing process contains few
complex ideas, there is little need for the elegance 
and redundancy of a highly syntax-oriented language.
 a simple and direct language will suffice for the 
problem.  the eventual users of this language are military

computer education in a graduate school of management

several years of experience have led to the belief that the creative
design and evaluation of management information systems requires
a thorough understanding of the related computer technology.  concepts
such as paging and priority interrupt systems can best be explained at the 
machine language level.  any machine used for exposition
should fulfill several criteria.  it should: (1) raise as few
spurious issues as possible; (2) allow, without undue effort, the
solution of interesting problems; (3) be capable of exposing all
outstanding issues of significance, capable of exposing all outstanding
issues of significance, within the chosen machine; (4) be
seful for pursuing issues in great depth when appropriate; (5) not
be committed to the equipment provided by any manufacturer; (6) be able to 
provide the student with diagnostic aids to a great depth;
(7) allow the student ready access to the machine; (8) be capable
of extension to expose new issues as they come along.  we have
constructed a simulated machine and its associated software which
meets these criteria.  this system, called the prism system,
is documented by a primer and a reference manual.

a study of errors, error-proneness, and error diagnosis in cobol

this paper provides data on cobol error frequency
for correction of errors in student-oriented 
compilers, improvement of teaching, and changes in programming
language.  cobol was studied because of 
economic importance, widespread usage, possible error-including
design, and lack of research.  the types 
of errors were identified in a pilot study; then, using
the 132 error types found, 1,777 errors were 
classified in 1,4000 runs of 73 cobol students.  error
density was high: 20 percent of the types contained 
80 percent of the total frequency, which implies high
potential effectiveness for software based correction 
of cobol.  surprisingly, only four high-frequency errors
were error-prone, which implies minimal error 
inducing design. 80 percent of cobol misspellings were classifiable
in the four error categories of previous 
researchers, which implies that cobol misspellings
are correctable by existent algorithms.  reserved 
word usage was not error-prone, which implies minimal
interference with usage of reserved words.  over

then to map this language, often using a macro processor,

language is the key factor in this operation.

the eschenbach drum scheme

the prime function of a drum, operating in
real time, is to perform accesses quickly.  the 
usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporate
engineering or hardware improvements.  in 
this paper the problem is attacked not by changing the

it operates.  at the outset, a drum is given a functional
definition.  then a simple design scheme (eschenbach) 
is introduced which enormously increases the rate of
accessing for drums so defined.  this is shown to 
enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer or
less expensive drums.  it is suggested that although 
the design scheme has a specific use, the method underlying it
has more general applicability.  the question 
of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised.  to
deal with this, a standard of efficiency is developed

nebula: a digital computer using a 20 mc glass delay line memory

oregon state university has designed and constructed
a medium-speed serial digital computer 
using glass delay lines circulating at 22 mc as memory.
 the design objectives as originally conceived 
in a special seminar were: (1) to be a research project
in computer design; (2) to be usable as an educational 
machine;and (3) to have easily modifiable hardware for
basic research in computer systems design.  an 
unusual arrangement of information within the 22 mc
memory allows a simple interface with the 340 kc 
arithmetic unit, which results in an effective zero latency
time and provides possibilities for an associative 
memory.  the arithmetic unit has a command structure similar
to

an interactive command generating facility

a facility to permit conversationally controlled tasks
to be executed in a noninteractive environment is proposed.
a means by which programs can generate interactive time-sharing commands
and receive the corresponding output response is presented.  the commands 
will be invoked as if they had been typed at a console keyboard.  it is 
argued that this facility will help overcome some of the current limitations 
in man-computer communication. a set of functions to accomplish the above 
which could be embedded into any string processing language is suggested, 
and necessary information pertinent to implementation of the facility on

a multiprogramming monitor for small machines

int, a combination hardware/software monitor
designed to control a wide variety of real-time 
input/output devices, is described.  the simple hardware
additions provide a uniform device to machine 
interface for such elements as keyboards graphic input
devices, and interval timers.  the software relieves 
the user program from the details

automation of etching-pattern layout

help (heuristic etching-pattern layout program)
is an application program developed to computerize 
the tedious and error-prone although vitally important
wiring design of printed circuit boards.  help 
helps automate a design stage one step closer to production
than logical design.  it can be used to design 
wiring patterns of two-layer circuit boards on which
ics in dual-in-line packages as well as discrete 
components such as transistors and resistors have been
placed.  help employs two methods of wiring.  
one is the heuristic method, which simulates human
approaches to wiring

top-to-bottom parsing rehabilitated?

this note is concerned with the efficiency
of the top-to-bottom parsing algorithm as used in 
connection with programming language grammars.  it is
shown, for instance, that retracing of unprofitable 
paths can often be eliminated by a suitable rearrangement
of the productions defining the grammar.  the 
essential weakness of the method

three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  these criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires,

the unix time-sharing system 

unix is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive
operating system for the digital equipment 
corporation pdp-11/40 and 11/45 computers.  it offers
a number of features seldom found even in larger 
operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system
incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible 
file, device, and inter-process i/o; (3) the ability to
initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command 
language selectable on a per-user basis; and (5) over
100 subsystems including a dozen languageshis 
paper discusses the nature and implementation of the
file system and of the user command interface.
