algorithms for finding a fundamental set of cycles for an undirected linear graph given the adjacency matrix of the graph the algorithm presented in this paper finds a spanning tree and then constructs the set of fundamental cycles our algorithm is slower than an algorithm presented by welch by a ratio of n 3 n is the number of nodes but requires less storage for graphs with a large number of nodes and edges when storage is limited our algorithm is superior to welch s however when the graphs are small or machine storage is very large welch s algorithm is superior timing estimates and storage requirements for both methods are presented cacm december 1967 gotlieb c c corneil d g ca671204 jb february 26 19782 35 pm 1504 4 1504 3040 4 1504 1145 5 1504 1504 5 1504 1504 5 1504 1504 5 1504 1847 5 1504 1961 5 1504 2052 5 1504 1008 6 1504 1013 6 1504 1369 6 1504 1504 6 1504 1504 6 1504 1504 6 1504 1540 6 1504 1847 6 1504
