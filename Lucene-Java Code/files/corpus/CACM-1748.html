a scheduling philosophy for multiprocessing systems a collection of basic ideas is presented which have been evolved by various workers over the past four years to provide a suitable framework for the design and analysis of multiprocessing systems the notions of process and state vector are discussed and the nature of basic operations on processes is considered some of the connections between processes and protection are analyzed a very general approach to priority oriented scheduling is described and its relationship to conventional interrupt systems is explained some aspects of time oriented scheduling are considered the implementation of the scheduling mechanism is analyzed in detail and the feasibility of embodying it in hardware established finally several methods for interlocking the execution of independent processes are presented and compared cacm may 1968 lampson b w time sharing multiprocessing process scheduling interlocks protection priority interrupt systems 4 31 4 32 6 21 ca680508 jb february 23 1978 9 13 am 1458 4 1748 1523 4 1748 1603 4 1748 1698 4 1748 1747 4 1748 1748 4 1748 1854 4 1748 1877 4 1748 1960 4 1748 2377 4 1748 2378 4 1748 2497 4 1748 2558 4 1748 2625 4 1748 2632 4 1748 2840 4 1748 2941 4 1748 3105 4 1748 3144 4 1748 1471 5 1748 1748 5 1748 1748 5 1748 1748 5 1748 1805 5 1748 1828 5 1748 1854 5 1748 2187 5 1748 1421 6 1748 1471 6 1748 1518 6 1748 1572 6 1748 1748 6 1748 1748 6 1748 1748 6 1748 1748 6 1748 1749 6 1748 1749 6 1748 1781 6 1748
