a note on compiling fixed point binary multiplications an algorithm is developed for compiling as a sequence of shifts additions and subtractions many fixed point binary multiplications involving a constant the most significant characteristics of the algorithm are the simplicity of the test which determines if the algorithm should be applied and the degree to which it suggests efficient object code cacm june 1971 glaswin h t compiling multiplications fixed point arithmetic 4 12 ca710605 jb february 3 1978 10 04 am 2185 5 2185 2185 5 2185 2185 5 2185 2296 5 2185 2952 5 2185 142 6 2185 162 6 2185 163 6 2185 192 6 2185 2185 6 2185 2185 6 2185 2727 6 2185
