on accurate floating point summation the accumulation of floating point sums is considered on a computer which performs t digit base b floating point addition with exponents in the range m to m an algorithm is given for accurately summing n t digit floating point numbers each of these n numbers is split into q parts forming qn t digit floating point numbers each of these is then added to the appropriate one of n auxiliary t digit accumulators finally the accumulators are added together to yield the computed sum in all qn n 1 t digit floating point additions are performed under usual conditions the relative error in the computed sum is at most t 1 v b 1 t for some v further with an additional q n 1 t digit additions the computed sum can be corrected to full t digit accuracy for example for the ibm 360 b 16 t 14 m 63 m 64 typical values for q and n are q 2 and n 32 in this case becomes n 32 768 and we have t 1 v b 1 t 4x16 13 cacm november 1971 malcolm m a floating point summation error analysis 5 11 5 19 ca711105 jb february 2 1978 10 48 am 1328 4 2144 1333 4 2144 2144 4 2144 1052 5 2144 2144 5 2144 2144 5 2144 2144 5 2144
