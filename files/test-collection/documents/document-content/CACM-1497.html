on the normalization requirement of divisor in divide and correct methods this paper presents an analysis on the normalization requirement of the divisor in a divide and correct method this analysis is made subject to the condition that not more than one correction is required to obtain the true quotient character from the trial estimate got from the division of a two precision segment of every partial remainder by a suitably rounded single precision divisor this segmented division is denoted here as a 2 1 precision basic division it is found that the normalization requirement could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors provided the magnitude of the character next to the leading character of the divisor is known if however the normalization is to be eliminated one has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands for the basic division also considered is the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an increase on the number of corrections on the quotient estimate got from a 2 1 precision basic division it is shown that such a scheme is economical only for small radices cacm december 1967 krishnamurthy e v nandi s k ca671210 jb february 26 1978 2 15 pm 1026 4 1497 1258 4 1497 1258 4 1497 1292 4 1497 1292 4 1497 1497 4 1497 1497 4 1497 1497 4 1497 1497 4 1497 1593 4 1497 1975 4 1497 1975 4 1497 2605 4 1497 107 5 1497 1026 5 1497 1292 5 1497 1497 5 1497 1497 5 1497 1497 5 1497 1593 5 1497 1975 5 1497 1026 6 1497 1292 6 1497 1497 6 1497
