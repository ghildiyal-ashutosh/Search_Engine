common phrases and minimum space text storage a method for saving storage space for text strings such as compiler diagnostic messages is described the method relies on hand selection of a set of text strings which are common to one or more messages these phrases are then stored only once the storage technique gives rise to a mathematical optimization problem determine how each message should use the available phrases to minimize its storage requirement this problem is nontrivial when phrases which overlap exist however a dynamic programming algorithm is presented which solves the problem in time which grows linearly with the number of characters in the text algorithm 444 applies to this paper cacm march 1973 wagner r a diagnostic messages error messages common phrases minimum space text storage optimization dynamic programming 3 73 4 10 5 41 ca730302 jb january 24 1978 1 12 pm 1973 4 2537 1992 4 2537 2138 4 2537 2203 4 2537 2251 4 2537 2530 4 2537 2537 4 2537 2537 4 2537 2543 4 2537 2559 4 2537 2573 4 2537 2991 4 2537 3053 4 2537 3083 4 2537 2107 5 2537 2530 5 2537 2537 5 2537 2537 5 2537 2537 5 2537 2623 5 2537 2819 5 2537 2107 6 2537 2501 6 2537 2537 6 2537 2537 6 2537 2537 6 2537
