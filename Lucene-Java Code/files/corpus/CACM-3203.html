grad assistant a program for symbolic algebraic manipulation and differentiation the general recursive algebra and differentiation assistant grad assistant now under development is a set of lisp functions which symbolically manipulate abd differentiate algebraic expressions it is designed for use with problemms in which a large amount of routine manipulation is to be done by a program without human intervention thus grad must recognize necessary simplifications without external guidance while some complicated expressions notably ones involving nested radicals and trigonometric functions do not yield completely to the present version it has proved quite useful indeed cacm august 1966 fletcher j g ca660817 es march 17 1982 10 10 am 1396 5 3203 3203 5 3203 3203 5 3203 3203 5 3203 964 6 3203 1028 6 3203 1029 6 3203 1083 6 3203 1132 6 3203 1214 6 3203 1278 6 3203 1334 6 3203 1365 6 3203 1386 6 3203 1387 6 3203 1388 6 3203 1392 6 3203 1393 6 3203 1394 6 3203 1395 6 3203 1396 6 3203 1397 6 3203 1496 6 3203 284 6 3203 407 6 3203 3199 6 3203 3200 6 3203 3201 6 3203 3202 6 3203 3203 6 3203 3204 6 3203 561 6 3203 730 6 3203
