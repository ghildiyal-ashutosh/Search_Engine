production systems or can we do better than bnf since the development of bnf the definition of the syntax of programming languages has been almost universally associated with context free requirements yet numerous interesting and difficult issues in syntax stem from the context sensitive requirements notably the compatibility between the declaration of an identifier and its uses the correspondence between actual and formal parameters and issues arising from block structure this paper explores the use of a formal notation called production systems in providing a readable and complete formal definition of syntax as a practical illustration a small but significant subset of pl i is considered a more detailed presentation as well as the application to define abstract syntax and translations between languages is given in a previous paper by the author cacm february 1974 ledgard h f syntax translation context sensitive grammars compilers formal definition pl i standards 4 2 5 21 5 23 ca740205 jb january 18 1978 1 07 pm 1086 4 2684 1132 4 2684 1234 4 2684 1263 4 2684 1265 4 2684 1270 4 2684 1323 4 2684 1358 4 2684 1379 4 2684 1380 4 2684 1453 4 2684 1464 4 2684 1469 4 2684 1484 4 2684 1486 4 2684 1491 4 2684 1491 4 2684 1498 4 2684 1613 4 2684 1614 4 2684 1781 4 2684 1781 4 2684 1781 4 2684 1825 4 2684 1860 4 2684 2083 4 2684 2178 4 2684 2178 4 2684 2178 4 2684 2179 4 2684 2252 4 2684 2325 4 2684 2326 4 2684 2326 4 2684 2341 4 2684 2470 4 2684 2546 4 2684 2645 4 2684 2652 4 2684 2684 4 2684 2684 4 2684 2684 4 2684 2842 4 2684 2929 4 2684 2934 4 2684 3044 4 2684 3069 4 2684 669 4 2684 679 4 2684 691 4 2684 761 4 2684 949 4 2684 989 4 2684 1303 5 2684 1323 5 2684 2684 5 2684 2684 5 2684 2684 5 2684 3184 5 2684
