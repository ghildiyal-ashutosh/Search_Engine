block structures indirect addressing and garbage collection programming languages have included explicit or implicit block structures to provide a naming convenience for the programmer however when indirect addressing is used as in snobol naming constraints may be introduced two modifications to snobol are described resulting in two desirable consequences 1 naming constraints disappear even when there is indirect addressing within function definitions and 2 there is a significant saving in the number of calls to the garbage collector because some garbage is collected at little expense each time a function returns to its calling program these modifications have been implemented as an extension to a snobol dialect cacm july 1969 kain r y block structures indirect addressing garbage collection local names snobol 4 22 ca690711 jb february 15 1978 6 49 pm 1869 4 1869 1869 4 1869 2513 4 1869 2665 4 1869 2723 4 1869 2855 4 1869 3106 4 1869 1549 5 1869 1570 5 1869 1869 5 1869 1869 5 1869 1869 5 1869 2060 5 1869 2770 5 1869 1380 6 1869 1421 6 1869 1469 6 1869 1477 6 1869 1491 6 1869 1786 6 1869 210 6 1869 1869 6 1869 1869 6 1869 1973 6 1869 1992 6 1869 2018 6 1869 2109 6 1869 2110 6 1869 2673 6 1869
