computer representation of planar regions by their skeletons any region can be regarded as a union of maximal neighborhoods of its points and can be specified by the centers and radii of these neighborhoods this set is a sort of skeleton of the region the storage required to represent a region in this way is comparable to that required when it is represented by encoding its boundary moreover the skeleton representation seems to have advantages when it is necessary to determine repeatedly whether points are inside or outside the region or to perform set theoretic operations on regions cacm february 1967 pfaltz j l rosenfeld a ca670212 jb february 28 1978 2 07 pm 1630 4 1630 2547 4 1630 2987 4 1630 3165 4 1630 1326 5 1630 1630 5 1630 1630 5 1630 1630 5 1630 2987 5 1630 1326 6 1630 1630 6 1630 2125 6 1630 2547 6 1630 2633 6 1630 421 6 1630 524 6 1630
