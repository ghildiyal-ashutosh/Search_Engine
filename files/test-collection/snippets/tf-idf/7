an overview of the ispl computer system design

this paper explores the advantages of the concurrent
design of the language, operating system, 
and machine (via microcode) to create an interactive programming
laboratory.  it describes the synergistic 
effect that the freedom to move and alter features from
one of these domains to another has had on the 
design of this system (which has not been implemented).
 this freedom simplified both incremental compilation 
and the system's addressing structure, and centralized the
communication mechanisms enabling the construction 
of hierarchical subsystems.  it also suggested

of new scheduling algorithms (decision of what to do) without
endangering the system integration (correctly 
performing the scheduling decisions).

considerations in the design of a multiple
computer system with extended core storage

the use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  the general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual cdc 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  in the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 an observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

as the awakening of computing awareness and the 
fostering of capability development at these schools. the
expertise and assistance from the central facility
as well as the sharing of ideas among the participants
were other important benefits.  both the quality

were found to play a key role in the effectiveness

on the implementation of security measures in information systems

the security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  a set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  the model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.

resource scheduling and allocation can be expensive
with regard to time and space in multiprogramming

tasks and resources with conflicting requirements. 
 detection and/or prevention of deadlocks can require
massive amounts of additional overhead if efficient 
usage of resources is to be maintained.  a resource
management program is described which uses linked 
lists along with other techniques to overcome a large
portion of this overhead.  the program, which is

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that

a policy-driven scheduler for a time-sharing system

the service received by a process from a time-sharing
operating system can be characterized 
by a resource count sum{w[i]r[ij]} 
************************
 count sum{w[i]r[ij]} where r[ij] is the
number of units of service received by process 
i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of the
service.  each class of users can be characterized 
by a policy function which specifies the amount of service
a user who belongs to this class should receive 
as a function of time.  priority changes dynamically
as a function of the difference between the service 
promised to the user by the policy function and the service
he actually receives.  a scheduling and swapping 
algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process
above its policy function will provide the specified 
level of service.  overhead can be reduced by avoiding
swaps of process which have received at least 
his level of service.  the algorithm has been implemented
in a general purpose operating system, and 
it has

efficient multiprogramming resource allocation and accounting

although sometimes thought of as only a component
of time-sharing operation, multiprogramming 
can involve broader questions of resource allocation,
since fairness is not required to meet a response 
criterion.  in a multiprogrammed system, it may serve
maximal resource use to be unfair, for example 
by holding an input/output channel idle for a program
while it completes a small amount of processor 
usage, enabling further use of the channel.  several
applications of this principle are given, and it 
is suggested that a multiprogramming executive might
dynamically adjust its allocation algorithms to 
gain efficiency.  allocation of resources is closely connected

a correctness proof of a topology information
main tenance protocol for a distributed computer 
network

in order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  one of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  the topology
information protocol that was implemented on the 
merit computer network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  it is based on baran's "hot
potato heuristic routing doctrine."  a correctness 
proof of this topology information protocol is also presented.

capability-based addressing

various addressing schemes making use of segment

************************
 making use of segment
tables are examined.  the inadequacies of 
these schemes when dealing with shared addresses are
explained. these inadequacies are traced to the 
lack of an efficient absolute address for objects in
these systems.  the direct use of a capability as 
an address is shown to overcome these difficulties
because it provides the needed absolute address.  
implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed.
 it is predicted that the use of tags to 
identify capabilities will dominate.  a hardware address
translation scheme which never requires the 
modification of the representation of capabilities is
suggested. the scheme uses a main memory hash table 
for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given
its unique code.  the hash table is avoided for
recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative
registers.  a computer using capability-based 
addressing may be substantially superior to present
systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of 
programming conventions, and efficient implementation.

errors to be caught at compile time.  a combination of
critical regions and event variables enables the 
programmer to control scheduling of resources among
competing processes to any degree desired.  these
