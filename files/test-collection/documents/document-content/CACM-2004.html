a procedure for generation of three dimensional half toned computer graphics presentations a description is given of an algorithm for producing computer generated half tone presentations of three dimensional polygonal surface structures this algorithm achieves a significant increase in speed of computation over the warnock algorithm developed at the university of utah and implemented also on the coordinated science laboratory cdc 1604 computer system at the university of illinois the history leading to the algorithm development and then the algorithm itself are described results are presented and are compared with computer runs achieved by the warnock approach an extension of the procedure to variable position illumination sources is also given cacm september 1970 bouknight w j half tone computer graphics line scan image processing hidden surface polygonal surface structure presentations 4 9 ca700901 jb february 10 1978 2 27 pm 2004 4 2004 2004 4 2004 2687 4 2004 2692 4 2004 1686 5 2004 1915 5 2004 2004 5 2004 2004 5 2004 2004 5 2004 2674 5 2004 2687 5 2004 2828 5 2004 1741 6 2004 1741 6 2004 1751 6 2004 1915 6 2004 2004 6 2004 2004 6 2004 2004 6 2004 2421 6 2004 2687 6 2004 2751 6 2004 2841 6 2004
