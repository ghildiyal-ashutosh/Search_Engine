a user authentication scheme not requiring secrecy in the computer

in many computer operating systems a user authenticates

************************
 a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system.  the system compares
this password with one recorded in a password 
table which is available to only the authentication
program.  the integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret.  in this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer.    all aspects of the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  the scheme is based
on using a function h which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  this function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  the intruder may know all about h and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert h to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  this paper discusses
issues surrounding selection of a suitable h.  two 
different plausible arguments are given that penetration
would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then 
argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.  finally,
some human engineering problems relating to 
the scheme are discussed.

considerations in the design of a multiple
computer system with extended core storage

the use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  the general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual cdc 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  in the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 an observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

on the implementation of security measures in information systems

the security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  a set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  the model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.

the design, implementation, and evaluation of a working set dispatcher

the behavior of a computer system is largely
dependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate 
the system resources to the processes competing for them.
 recent research in time-sharing paging systems 
has developed the working set model for program behavior,
and are source allocation strategy based on 
this model has been proposed.  two implementations
along these principles have been reported, but it 
seems that in neither case have further results been
announced.  this report discusses the design and 
implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set
principle, presents data to permit analysis of 
its behavior, and indicates future directions of research
on methods of controlling a computer system.

software in present-day terminology.  several 
design concepts such as address-generation and store
management have evolved in the progression from 
mark i to atlas.  the wider impact of manchester innovations

dynamic verification of operating system decisions

dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  the dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the prime system
being designed and constructed at the university 
of california, berkeley.  prime is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 the technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  on prime,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

organizing matrices and matrix operations for paged memory systems

matrix representations 
************************


matrix representations and operations are examined
for the purpose of minimizing the page faulting 
occurring in a paged memory system.  it is shown that
carefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to 
enormous savings in the number of page faults occurring
when only a small part of the total matrix can 
be in main memory at one time.  examination of addition,
multiplication, and inversion algorithms shows 
that a partitioned matrix representation (i.e. one submatrix
or partition per page) in most cases induced 
fewer page faults than a row-by-row representation.
 the number of page-pulls required by these matrix 
manipulation algorithms is also studied as a function
of the number of pages of main memory available 
to the algorithm.

the multics virtual memory: concepts and design

as experience with use of on-line operating
systems has grown, the need 
************************
 has grown, the need to share information 
among system users has become increasingly apparent.
 many contemporary systems permit some degree of 
sharing.  usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing
several users to share data via input and output 
of information stored in files kept in secondary storage.
 through the use of segmentation, however, 
multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and
system programs of all information, independent 
of its physical storage location.  information is stored
in segments each of which is potentially sharable 
and carries its own independent attributes of size and access
privilege.  here, the design and implementation 
considerations of segmentation and sharing in multics
are first discussed under the assumption that all 
information resides in large, segmented main memory. 
since the size of main memory on contemporary systems 
is rather limited, it is then shown how the multics
software achieves the effect of a large segmented 
main memory through the use of the honeywell
645 segmentation and paging hardware.

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that

a simple linear model of demand paging performance

predicting the performance of a proposed automatically
managed multilevel memory system requires 
a model of the patterns by which programs refer to the
information stored in the memory.  some recent 
experimental measurements on the multics virtual memory
suggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably 
simple program reference model will suffice.  the simple
model combines the effect of the information 
reference pattern with the effect of the automatic management
algorithm to produce a single, composite 
statement: the mean number of memory references between
paging exceptions increases linearly with the 
size of the paging memory.  the resulting model is easy
to manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse 
problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory,
arranging for reproducible memory usage charges, 
and estimating the amount of core memory sharing.

a comparison of hardware and software associative
memories in the context of computer graphics

the associative processing of line drawings (apld)
system utilizes a hardware associative memory 
and creates, modifies, deletes, stores, and retrieves
two-dimensional line drawings consisting of poin ts,
lines, rectangles, and triangles. the apld functions
were duplicated on the tx-2 computer at m.'s 
lincoln laboratory under the leap language and data
structure,  a comparison of the hardware approach 
with the software simulation illustrates the advantages
of the hardware associative memory in three areas: 
(1) processing speed, (2) storage requirements, and (3)
flexibility.  the major problem areas of hardware 
associative memory technology, namely input/output
and cost effectiveness, are also addressed.

formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures

virtual machine systems have been implemented
on a limited number of third generation computer 
systems, e.g. cp-67 on the ibm 360/67.  from previous
empirical studies, it is known that certain third 
generation computer systems, e.g. the dec pdp-10, cannot
support a virtual machine system.  in this paper, 
model of a third-generation-like computer system is
developed.  formal techniques are used to derive 
precise sufficient conditions to test whether such
an architecture can support virtual machines.

characteristics of program localities

the term "locality" has been used to denote that
subset of a program's segments which are referenced 
during a particular phase of its execution.  a program's
behavior can be characterized in terms of its 
residence in localities of various sizes and lifetimes,
and the transitions between these localities. 
 in this paper the concept of a locality is made more explicit
through a formal definition of what constitutes 
a phase of localized reference behavior, and by a corresponding
mechanism for the detection of localities 
in actual reference strings.  this definition provides
for the existence of a hierarchy of localities 
at any given time, and the reasonableness of the definition
is supported by examples taken from actual 
programs.  empirical data from a sample of production
algol 60 programs is used to display distributions 
of locality sizes and lifetimes, and these results are
discussed in terms of their implications for the 
modeling of program behavior and memory management in virtual memory systems.

a model of memory contention in a paging machine

this paper is concerned with certain aspects of contention
for main memory resources in a multiprogrammed 
computer system operating under demand paging.  in
the model presented, the number of page-frames of 
main memory allocated to a problem program varies in
time.  these changes in memory configuration are 
represented explicitly in the model, cpu requirements and
page exception characteristics of program material 
being described statistically.  expressions for the distribution
of the number of page-frames allocated 
to an executing program, the long run expected fraction
of a program's execution time in a given number 
of page-frames, and the average execution interval of the
multiprogrammed load are obtained.  it is pointed 
out heuristically and demonstrated numerically that
an increase is obtain able in the average execution 
interval of the multiprogrammed load over that resulting
from equal fixed partitioning of main memory.

a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  the use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  in this paper a very

.  this introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  after some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  the first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  the problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  the use of cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  this
section also assesses the effect of the data base 
task group proposals.  the final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

to determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportion

three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  these criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  to define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

to service simulation programs as represented by 18
test cases.  algorithm performance was measured in
terms of processing time, memory usage, and external memory
fragmentation.  algorithms main taining separate 
free space lists for each size of memory block used
tended to perform quite well compared with other 
algorithms.  simple algorithms operating on memory ordered
lists (without any free list) performed surprisingly 
well.  algorithms employing power-of-two block sizes
had favorable processing requirements but generally 
unfavorable memory usage.  algorithms employing lifo, fifo,
or memory ordered free lists generally performed 
poorly compared with others.

dynamic memory repacking

a probabilistic model of a multiprogramming system
is exercised in order to determine the conditions 
under which the dynamic repacking of main memory is beneficial.
 an expression is derived for the maximum 
interference that a repacking process may introduce
before the original performance of the system is 
degraded.  alternative approaches to repacking are discussed,
and the operating conditions that lead
