display procedures although the use of structured display files is widespread in interactive computer graphics these structures present a number of problems which tend to restrict their generality and usefulness this paper discusses some of these problems and suggests an alternative approach to display system design which avoids the use of structured display files this technique employs display procedures to generate information for display by including transformations within calls to these procedures it is possible both to simplify the specification of pictures and to speed up their generation display procedures permit picture elements to be defined conditionally and also facilitate the processing of inputs from pointing devices the paper is illustrated by examples from aversion of the euler language in which display procedures were implemented cacm october 1971 newman w m computer graphics programming languages display files 4 20 4 41 ca711004 jb february 2 1978 1 11 pm 1542 4 2152 1683 4 2152 1693 4 2152 1781 4 2152 1787 4 2152 1836 4 2152 1945 4 2152 2003 4 2152 2002 4 2152 2060 4 2152 2061 4 2152 2082 4 2152 2091 4 2152 2152 4 2152 2152 4 2152 2179 4 2152 2340 4 2152 2356 4 2152 2546 4 2152 2603 4 2152 2698 4 2152 2708 4 2152 2824 4 2152 2982 4 2152 2986 4 2152 3045 4 2152 3093 4 2152 1491 5 2152 1767 5 2152 2152 5 2152 2152 5 2152 2152 5 2152
