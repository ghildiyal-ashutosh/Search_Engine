an efficient data structure for the simulation event set recently algorithms have been presented for the realization of event scheduling routines suitable for general purpose discrete event simulation systems several exhibited a performance superior to that of commonly used simple linked list algorithms in this paper a new event scheduling algorithm is presented which improves on two aspects of the best of the previously published algorithms first the new algorithm s performance is quite insensitive to skewed distributions and second its worst case complexity is o n where n is the number of events in the set furthermore tests conducted to estimate the average complexity showed it to be nearly independent of n cacm august 1977 franta w r maly k simulation time flow mechanisms event scanning mechanisms multilinked lists 3 34 4 22 5 5 8 1 ca770807 jb december 28 1977 7 15 am 2844 4 2936 2844 4 2936 2936 4 2936 2936 4 2936 3051 4 2936 3064 4 2936 3064 4 2936 3109 4 2936 2742 5 2936 2767 5 2936 2936 5 2936 2936 5 2936 2936 5 2936 3064 5 2936 1846 6 2936 1939 6 2936 2742 6 2936 2767 6 2936 2936 6 2936
