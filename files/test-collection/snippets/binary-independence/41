neater2: a pl/i source statement reformatter

neater2 accepts a pl/i source program and operates on it to produce
a reformatted version.  when in the logical mode, neater2 indicates
the logical structure of the source program in the indentation
pattern of its output.  logic errors discovered through neater2
logical analysis are discovered much more economically than is possible
through compilation and trial runs.

automatic derivation of microsentences

the decomposition of long complex english sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  to explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the harvard multipath analysis program.  the basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  a program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 the authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic

optimal surface reconstruction from planar contours

in many scientific and technical endeavors,
a three-dimensional solid must be reconstructed 
from serial sections, either to aid in the comprehension
of the object's structure or to facilitate its 
automatic manipulation and analysis.  this paper presents
a general solution to the problem of constructing 
a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours. 
this surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, 
is constructed by separately determining an optimal
surface between each pair of consecutive contours.
 determining such a surface is reduced to the problem
of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed 
toroidal graph.  a new fast algorithm for finding such
cycles is utilized.  also developed is a closed-form 
expression, in term of the number of contour poin ts, for
an upper bound on the number of operations required 
to execute the algorithm.  an illustrated example which
involves the construction of a minimum area surface 
describing a human head is included.

a simple user-oriented compiler source language
for programming automatic test equipment

for the nonprogrammer, difficulty in using
a language increases rapidly with the number of 
nonproblem-oriented conventions.  a simple language, even
if inelegant, which considers the user's background 
as part of the problem may be more effective than a source
language containing subtle and more powerful 
capabilities.  the language described in this paper is
used to write computer programs which test

equipment.  because this testing process contains few

assumption is made that the program development

eventual system will run.  it is only when this 
production machine is unavailable or when its programming
environment is totally inadequate that alternatives 
are considered.  in this paper it is suggested that
there are many other situations where it would be 
advantageous to separate the program development and

a note on storage fragmentation and program segmentation

the main purpose of this paper is the presentation
of some of the results of a series of simulation 
experiments investigating the phenomenon of storage fragmentation.
 two different types of storage fragmentation 
are distinguished: (1) external fragmentation, namely the
loss in storage utilization caused by the inability 
to make use of all available storage after it has been
fragmented into a large number of separate blocks; 
and (2) internal fragmentation, the loss of utilization
caused by rounding up a request for storage, 
rather than allocating only the exact number of words required.
 the most striking result is the apparently 
general rule that rounding up requests for storage,
to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks 
coexisting in storage, causes more loss of storage
by increased internal fragmentation than is saved 
by decreased external fragmentation.  described also are
a method of segment allocation and an accompanying 
technique for segment addressing which take advantage
of the above result.  evidence is presented of 
possible advantages of the method over conventional paging techniques.
