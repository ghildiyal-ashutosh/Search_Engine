natural language question-answering systems: 1969

recent experiments in programming natural
language question-answering systems are reviewed
to summarize the methods that have been developed for syntactic, semantic,
and logical analysis of english strings.  it is concluded
that at least minimally effective techniques have been devised for
answering questions from natural language subsets in small scale
experimental systems and that a useful paradigm has evolved to guide
research efforts in the field.  current approaches to semantic
analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective beginnings
but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of 
meaning or to applications over large subsets of english. 
generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language-processing 
systems based on dictionaries with thousands of entries-with
correspondingly large grammars and semantic systems-may entail
a new order of complexity and require the invention and development
of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis and questions answering.

an interference matching technique for inducing abstractions

a method for inducing knowledge by abstraction
from a sequence of training examples is described. 
 the proposed method, interference matching, induces abstractions
by finding relational properties common 
to two or more exemplars.  three tasks solved by a program
that uses an interference-matching algorithm 
are presented.  several problems concerning the description
of the training examples and the adequacy 
of interference matching are discussed, and directions
for future research are considered.

considerations in the design of a multiple
computer system with extended core storage

the use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  the general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual cdc 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  in the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 an observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

a vector space model for automatic indexing

in a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  an approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model.

automatic derivation of microsentences

the decomposition of long complex english sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  to explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the harvard multipath analysis program.  the basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  a program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 the authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems, they may have practical

requirements for advanced programming systems for list processing

list processing systems should be designed to
facilitate production of large programs to manipulate 
large complex symbolic data stores.  this paper presents
an overview of a number of system features which 
the author feels are important to improve the productivity
of programmers working in such domains.  a 
system view it taken, rather than focusing just on language
features, since algorithms must be not only 
coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made
efficient, and run on data.  because of this general 
framework,the requirements specified are applicable
to the design of advanced programming systems for 
a wide range of applications.  three aspects of programming
systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  the  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.

 thus, for example, the structure for retrieval

pictorial pattern recognition and the

the availability of interactive, three-dimensional,

to frame "structural hypotheses" which 
can computationally be tested and refined by reference
to the experimental data.  application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and

a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 however, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such

retrieval-update speed tradeoffs using combined indices

in a paper in the november 1970 communications
of the acm, v. y. lum introduced a technique 
of file indexing named combined indices.  this technique
permitted decreased retrieval time at the cost 
of increased storage space.  this paper examines combined
indices under conditions of file usage with 
different fractions of retrieval and update.  tradeoff
curves are developed to show minimal cost of file 
usage by grouping various partially combined indices.

a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by lewin, is based on the use of special 
************************
 on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  the use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  in this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

on simulating networks of parallel processes

some of the problems of simulating discrete
event systems, particularly computer systems, on 
a conventional digital computer are dealt with.  the
systems are assumed to be described as a network 
of interconnected sequential processes.  briefly reviewed
are the common techniques used to handle such

be ignored, or can be handled by simple priority 
rules.  following this, the problem of dealing with simultaneous
events in separate processes is introduced. 
 an abstraction of this problem is developed which admits
solution for a majority of commonly encountered
problems.  the technique will either find a method of
simulating the parallel events or report that none 
can be found.  in some of the latter cases it is shown
to be possible to find a solution by extending

 this method treats text as a string of characters rather
than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  the members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.
the rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages.

introduction to "feature analysis of
generalized data base management systems"

this paper is a separately published introduction
to a main report which analyzes the features 
of generalized data base management systems.  this introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  after some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  the first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  the problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  the use of cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  this
section also assesses the effect of the data base 
task group proposals.  the final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

************************
 currently in use by top management in most us local
governments.  what exists is management-oriented 
computing, involving the use of relatively unsophisticated
applications.  despite the unsophisticated 
nature of these systems, management use of computing is
surprisingly common, but also varied in its extent 
among local governments.  management computing is most
prevalent in those governments with professional 
management practices where top management is supportive
of computing and tends to control computing decisions 
and where department users have less control over design
and implementation activities.  finally, management 
computing clearly has impacts for top managers, mostly
involving improvements in decision information.

consumer difficulties with computerized transactions: 
an empirical investigation

the prevalence with which errors may be encountered by the 
end targets of a computerized process is assessed.  how many and
what type of errors occur?  how easily are they corrected?  what
is the reaction of consumers to errors-to a failure to correct
them?  what can be learned by designers of large management packages
from such data? results show that with the present state of the
art, approximately 40 percent of individuals (or households) having
average contacts with different types of accounts experience one
or more errors per year.  eighty percent relate to billing.  attempts
to correct errors often turned out to be difficult and not always
successful. there appears to be some conflict between computer-using
organizations and their public.  also the role of poor man
agement packages including poor software is indicated.  while most
management systems may be adequate, results

sentence paraphrasing from a conceptual base

a model of natural language based on an underlying
language-free representation of meaning 
is described.  a program based on this model is able
to produce sentence paraphrases which demonstrate 
understanding with respect to a given context.  this
generator operates in conjunction with a natural 
language analyzer and a combined memory and inference model.
 in generating sentences from meaning structures, 
the program employs both the information retrieval and
deduction capabilities

suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by goffman, verhoeff and belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  for searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  the inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  two approaches

computing capabilities at western european universities

this report on the author's trip to universities
in western europe in the summer of 1966 gives 
brief descriptions of computing activities at each institution
visited.  present equipment capabilities 
vary from moderate to large scale; however, many institutions
plan to acquire complex time-shared systems 
in the near future.  in the author's opinion, the state
of the art lags behind that on this continent. 
 this lag is attributed to four principal factors: (a)
the handicapping organization of academic procedures; 
(b) the university-government financial relationship;
(c) the subordinated organization of the computing 
facility; (d) the paucity of professional interchange
of knowledge.  the effects of these

three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  these criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  to define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

dynamic response time prediction for computer networks

if the ultimate aim of a computing network
is resource sharing, then the human component as 
well as the technical component of networking must
be fully investigated to achieve this goal.  this 
research is a first step toward assisting the user in participating
in the vast store of resources available 
on a network. analytical, simulation, and statistical performance
evaluation tools are employed to investigate 
the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitor
that is capable of providing comparative response 
time information for users wishing to process various
computing applications at some network computing 
node.  the research clearly reveals that sufficient
system data are currently obtainable, at least for

capability-based addressing

lack of an efficient absolute address for objects in
these systems.  the direct use of 
************************
.  the direct use of a capability as 
an address is shown to overcome these difficulties
because it provides the needed absolute address.  
implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed.
 it is predicted that the use of tags to 
identify capabilities will dominate.  a hardware address
translation scheme which never requires the 
modification of the representation of capabilities is
suggested. the scheme uses a main memory hash table 
for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given
its unique code.  the hash table is avoided for
recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative
registers.  a computer using capability-based 
addressing may be substantially superior to present
systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of 
programming conventions, and efficient implementation.
