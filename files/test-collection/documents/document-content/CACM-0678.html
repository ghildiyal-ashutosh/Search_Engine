optimizing bit time computer simulation a major component of a bit time computer simulation program is the boolean compiler the compiler accepts the boolean functions representing the simulated computer s digital circuits and generates corresponding sets of machine instructions which are subsequently executed on the host computer techniques are discussed for increasing the sophistication of the boolean compiler so as to optimize bit time computer simulation the techniques are applicable to any general purpose computer cacm november 1963 katz j h ca631114 jb march 13 1978 3 34 pm 678 4 678 1030 5 678 270 5 678 1886 5 678 1939 5 678 678 5 678 678 5 678 678 5 678 1030 6 678 678 6 678 678 6 678 678 6 678
