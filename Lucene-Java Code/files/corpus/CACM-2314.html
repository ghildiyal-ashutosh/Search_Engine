requirements for advanced programming systems for list processing list processing systems should be designed to facilitate production of large programs to manipulate large complex symbolic data stores this paper presents an overview of a number of system features which the author feels are important to improve the productivity of programmers working in such domains a system view it taken rather than focusing just on language features since algorithms must be not only coded in a language form but debugged modified made efficient and run on data because of this general framework the requirements specified are applicable to the design of advanced programming systems for a wide range of applications three aspects of programming systems are highlighted good interactive facilities programmable control structures and sophisticated data communication mechanisms interactive features are described to facilitate program composition entry testing debugging editing optimization and packaging implementation of a generalized environment structure model specified would allow programming of various control regimes including multiprocesses coroutines and backtracking alternative methods of procedure invocation required include invocation by pattern and by monitoring condition the need for extended data forms storage management and extensibility are stressed as is the duality of data retrieval and function evaluation syntax directed input and output of data would facilitate use of complex data stores cacm july 1972 bobrow d g list processing programming languages design of programming languages interactive systems control structures data structures programming primitives semantics advanced programming systems 1 3 4 2 4 22 4 3 4 32 5 23 5 24 ca720714 jb january 30 1978 1 30 pm 1570 4 2314 1708 4 2314 1781 4 2314 1826 4 2314 1860 4 2314 1945 4 2314 2156 4 2314 2168 4 2314 2249 4 2314 2314 4 2314 2314 4 2314 2314 4 2314 2314 4 2314 2317 4 2314 2719 4 2314 2736 4 2314 2833 4 2314 2842 4 2314 1098 5 2314 1626 5 2314 2082 5 2314 2148 5 2314 2314 5 2314 2314 5 2314 2314 5 2314 2438 5 2314 1826 6 2314 2314 6 2314
