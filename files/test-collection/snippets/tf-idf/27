an application of formac

a nonlinear circuit analysis problem is stated
and the way in which it was solved using formac 
is indicated.  the solution of the problem using formac
was notable since several other methods that 
were tried failed.  the problem is straightforward (although
untenable by hand) but nevertheless involved 
an elaborate use of the formac language.  the program
was fairly large and utilized practically every 
command.  in particular, it made extensive use of the
part command.  several tricks were necessary in 
order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the
formac system.  this paper is more concerned with 
the use of programming techniques in formac than with
the actual engineering problem, although readers 
may be interested in the problem because

reverse path forwarding of broadcast packets

a broadcast packet is for delivery to all
nodes of a network.  algorithms for accomplishing 
this delivery through a store-and-forward packet switching
 computer network include (1) transmission 
of separately addressed packets. (2) multidestination
addressing, (3) hot potato forwarding,(4) spanning 
tree forwarding, and (5) source based forwarding.  to
this list of algorithms we add (6) reverse path 
forwarding, a broadcast routing method which exploits
routing procedures and data structures already 
available for packet switching.  reverse path forwarding
is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing 
 in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks.
 the algorithm is described 
************************
.
 the algorithm is described as being practical 
 because it is not optimal according to metrics developed
for its analysis in this paper, and also because 
it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity

cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems

a cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.  the chief computational advantage 
offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed
achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel 
processing.  in this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  for example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  a major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  in particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, pert chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks.

actions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering,
restructuring, and copying of constituents necessary to produce
deep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from a
transformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow for a
powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take
advantage of semantic information to guide the parsing.

a position paper on computing and communications

the effective operation of free enterprise in
creating the envisioned information service industry 
is dependent upon three accomplishments: (1) the restructuring
of our information processing industry 
so that a clear division of costs is made among computing,
communications, and the development of information 
services; (2) the wide use of multiaccess system concepts
so that information services may share in the 
use of computer installations and so that the cost of their
construction is reasonable; and (3) the development 
of public, message-switched communications services so
that adequate provisions are made for information 
security.

on quadratic adaptive routing algorithms

two analytic models 
************************


two analytic models of a store-and-forward communications
network are constructed, one to find 
the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate
the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained 
by an adaptive routing algorithm.  these models show that
adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  the form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  the modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  simulation results are presented 
which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.

overhead in the arpanet are considered. 
 the source of this over head is separated into various
levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics 
of each level are summarized.  then the line efficiency
for various models of system use is studied. 
 some measurements of line efficiency for the arpanet are
presented and by extrapolation these measurements 
are used to anticipate overhead in a heavily loaded network.
similar results are derived for a recently 
proposed network protocol and compared with those for the current system.

exclusive simulation of activity in digital networks

a technique for simulating 
************************
s

a technique for simulating the detailed logic
networks of large and active 
************************
s of large and active digital systems 
is described.  essential objectives sought are improved
ease and economy in model generation, economy 
in execution time and space, and a facility for handling
simultaneous activities.  the main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities.  the passage of
time is simulated in a precise, quantitative fashion 
and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous
and asynchronous logic.  certain aspects 
of the techniques described may be used for the simulation
of network structures other than digital networks.

a note on information organization and storage

since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 a general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  there are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  the use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different

 results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  thus the problem of information organization and

and formulating algorithms under a given set of

a card format for reference files in information processing

this paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  an 80-column ibm card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  the format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  the reference
material includes basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
the identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source of the reference. 
************************
, and source of the reference.  the 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment,
machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing.

some theorems to aid in solving the file allocation problem

the file allocation problem-i.e. the problem
of finding the optimal set of network sites at 
which to locate copies of a file-is known to be, in general,
polynomial complete.  heuristics and other 
aids to finding optimal, or near-optimal, solutions are
therefore much needed.  in this paper we present 
three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicate
that certain sites should (or should not) be 
included in an optimal allocation.

of horner's rule for polynomials.  it is 
also shown how mean queue size and throughput an be obtained

a correctness proof of a topology information
main tenance protocol for a distributed computer 
network

in order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  one of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  the topology
information protocol that was implemented on the 
merit computer network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  it is based on baran's "hot
potato heuristic routing doctrine."  a correctness 
proof of this topology information protocol is also presented.

dynamic response time prediction for computer networks

if the ultimate aim 
************************
s

if the ultimate aim of a computing network
is resource sharing, then the human component as 
well as the technical component of networking must
be fully investigated to achieve this goal.  this 
research is a first step toward assisting the user in participating
in the vast store of resources available 
on a network. analytical, simulation, and statistical performance
evaluation tools are employed to investigate 
the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitor
that is capable of providing comparative response 
time information for users wishing to process various
computing applications at some network computing 
node.  the research clearly reveals that sufficient
system data are currently obtainable, at least for 
the five diverse arpa network systems studied in detail,
to describe and predict the response time for 
network time-sharing systems as it depends on some
measure of system activity or load level.
