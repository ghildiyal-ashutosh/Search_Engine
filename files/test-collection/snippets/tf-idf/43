components of the electrocardiogram, long series 
of patient heart cycles must be examined before valid
comparison of different heart beats can be made. 
a technique is presented for the automatic analysis

texture and reflection in computer generated images

in 
************************
 generated images

in 1974 catmull developed a new algorithm
for rendering images of bivariate surface patches. 
 this paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
 the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  the intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. the shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  the patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 the amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  several examples of images synthesized 
using these new techniques are included.

expanding the editing function in language data processing

in automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  this paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  applications are described,

digital synthesis of correlated stationary noise

in this note we propose a method of generating
stationary noise with a prescribed auto-covariance 
function by digital methods.  the need for such a technique
often arises in testing the performance of 
data processing and engineering systems, where inputs
corrupted with correlated noise (of a known form) 
are required.  the technique is quite simple and produces
strict-sense stationary noise which agrees 
approximately with r(t), the prescribed auto-covariance
function (acf), over an interval [-t(0), t(0)]. 
 the method consists of approximating the spectral density
by a periodic process with spectral lines, 
and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random
phases and appropriate amplitudes.  in order to 
simplify discussion of the statistical properties of the
noise generated, the technique is first presented 
in terms of exact harmonic analysis.  in practice, discrete

reduction in computation and storage which 
can be achieved when the series is real.  also discussed

the algorithm which perform only (n/4) log2 (n/2) complex
multiply and add operations, and which require 
only n real storage locations in analyzing each n-point record.

a computer analysis method for thermal diffusion 
************************
 method for thermal diffusion in biochemical systems

in the thermal detection of rapid biochemical
reactions it is necessary to correct the temperature 
data for transient heat conduction losses in a cylindrical
calorimeter.  to handle the complexities arising 
from varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulating
layers, a computer program was developed 
which gives the temperature distribution of the system
as a function of radius and time.  this distribution 
is corrected at each step by a subroutine which calculates
the instantaneous chemical state of there 
action, as well as the heat produced by this reaction.
 the program is based on a direct statement of 
fourier's law of heat conduction and the chemical rate
equation to provide a "bookkeeping law" to follow 
the reactants and the flow of heat packets, in such a
way that the computer continually stores the heat 
distribution.  a computer analysis method is here regarded

a modification of efroymson's technique for stepwise regression analysis

the computational technique conventionally used
for stepwise multiple linear regression requires 
the storage of an n x n matrix of data.  when the number
of variables, n, is large, this requirement 
taxes the storage capacity of presently used machinery.
 the near symmetry of the matrices involved permits 
a modification requiring only half the storage and computations
of the conventional algorithm and this 
additional storage allows the analysis of problems containing
more variables.  alternatively, it permits 
the analysis of problems containing the same number
of variables but with all computations performed 
in double precision.

sentences have been based on augmented context-free

on ten years' experience parsing text sentences with
