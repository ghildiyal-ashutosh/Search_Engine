What articles exist which deal with TSS (Time Sharing System), an operating system for IBM computers?
I am interested in articles written either by Prieve or Udo Pooch Prieve, B. Pooch, U.
Intermediate languages used in construction of multi-targeted compilers; TCOLL
I'm interested in mechanisms for communicating between disjoint processes, possibly, but not exclusively, in a distributed environment. I would rather see descriptions of complete mechanisms, with or without implementations, as opposed to theoretical work on the abstract problem. Remote procedure calls and message-passing are examples of my interests.
I'd like papers on design and implementation of editing interfaces, window-managers, command interpreters, etc. The essential issues are human interface design, with views on improvements to user efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction.
Interested in articles on robotics, motion planning particularly the geometric and combinatorial aspects. We are not interested in the dynamics of arm motion.
I am interested in distributed algorithms - concurrent programs in which processes communicate and synchronize by using message passing. Areas of particular interest include fault-tolerance and techniques for understanding the correctness of these algorithms.

I'd like to find articles describing the use of singular value decomposition in digital image processing. Applications include finding approximations to the original image and restoring images that are subject to noise. An article on the subject is H. Andrews and C. Patterson "Outer product expansions and their uses in digital image processing", American Mathematical Andrews, H. Patterson, C.
I'd like to find articles describing graph algorithms that are based on the eigenvalue decomposition (or singular value decomposition) of the ajacency matrix for the graph. I'm especially interested in any heuristic algorithms for graph coloring and graph isomorphism using this method.
Articles about the sensitivity of the eigenvalue decomposition of real matrices, in particular, zero-one matrices. I'm especially interested in the separation of eigenspaces corresponding to distinct eigenvalues. Articles on the subject: C. Davis and W. Kahn, "The rotation of eigenvectors by a permutation:, SIAM J. Numerical Analysis, vol. 7, no. 1 (1970); G. Stewart, "Error bounds for approximate invariant subspaces of closed linear operators", SIAM J. Numerical Analysis., Vol. 8, no. 4 (1971). Davis, C. Kahn, W. Stewart, G.
Currently interested in isolation of root of polynomial; there is an old more recent material. Heindel, L.
Probabilistic algorithms especially those dealing with algebraic and symbolic manipulation. Some examples: Rabiin, "Probabilistic algorithm on finite field", SIAM Waztch, "Probabilistic testing of polynomial identities", SIAM Rabin,M.
Fast algorithm for context-free language recognition or parsing
Articles describing the relationship between data types and concurrency (e.g. what is the type of a process? when is a synchronization attempt between two processes "type correct"? in a message-passing system is there any notion of the types of messages?--i.e. any way to check that the sender of the message and the receiver are both treating the bit stream as some particular type)
What is the type of a module? (I don't want the entire literature on Abstract Data Types here, but I'm not sure how to phrase this to avoid it. I'm interested in questions about how one can check that a module "matches" contexts in which it is used.)
What does type compatibility mean in languages that allow programmer defined types? (You might want to restrict this to "extensible" languages that allow definition of abstract data types or programmer-supplied definitions of operators like *, +.)
List all articles dealing with data types in the following languages: that are referenced frequently in papers on the above languages (e.g. catch any languages with interesting type structures that I might have missed).
