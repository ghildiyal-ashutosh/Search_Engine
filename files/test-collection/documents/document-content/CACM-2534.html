design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for pl i pl c is a compiler for a dialect for pl i the design objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment for the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler the most remarkable characteristic of pl c is its perseverance it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user established error limit is reached this requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution and the design of pl c is dominated by this consideration pl c also introduces several explicit user controlled facilities for program testing to accommodate these extensions to pl i without abandoning compatibility with ibm compiler pl c permits pseudo comments constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source test or comment in spite of the diagnostic effort pl c is a fast and efficient processor it effectively demonstrates that compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered even when a sophisticated source language is employed and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly cacm march 1973 conway r w wilcox t r compilers debugging pl i programming languages 1 5 4 12 4 42 ca730305 jb january 24 1978 10 45 am 1179 4 2534 1288 4 2534 1323 4 2534 1358 4 2534 1380 4 2534 1544 4 2534 1646 4 2534 1665 4 2534 1781 4 2534 1781 4 2534 1787 4 2534 1989 4 2534 2111 4 2534 2112 4 2534 2182 4 2534 2251 4 2534 2497 4 2534 2534 4 2534 2534 4 2534 2534 4 2534 2534 4 2534 2534 4 2534 2534 4 2534 2534 4 2534 2541 4 2534 2543 4 2534 2556 4 2534 2556 4 2534 2559 4 2534 2650 4 2534 2650 4 2534 2698 4 2534 2708 4 2534 2708 4 2534 2733 4 2534 2770 4 2534 2820 4 2534 2887 4 2534 3053 4 2534 3073 4 2534 3083 4 2534 3155 4 2534 1787 5 2534 1959 5 2534 1973 5 2534 2111 5 2534 2182 5 2534 2534 5 2534 2534 5 2534 2534 5 2534 2708 5 2534 2820 5 2534 2971 5 2534 3045 5 2534 799 5 2534 830 5 2534 1477 6 2534 1477 6 2534 1491 6 2534 1491 6 2534 1787 6 2534 1835 6 2534 1974 6 2534 2111 6 2534 2534 6 2534 2534 6 2534 2534 6 2534 2534 6 2534 2556 6 2534 680 6 2534 799 6 2534
