an experimental evaluation of data type conventions the language in which programs are written can have a substantial effect on the reliability of the resulting programs this paper discusses an experiment that compares the programming reliability of subjects using a statically typed language and a typeless language analysis of the number of errors and the number of runs containing errors shows that at least in one environment the use of a statically typed language can increase programming reliability detailed analysis of the errors made by the subjects in programming solutions to reasonably small problems shows that the subjects had difficulty manipulating the representation of data cacm august 1977 gannon j d data types experimentation language design redundancy reliable software 4 22 ca770806jb december 28 1977 7 32 am 2411 4 2937 2709 4 2937 2889 4 2937 2937 4 2937 2989 4 2937 3005 4 2937 3025 4 2937 3101 4 2937 2138 5 2937 2937 5 2937 2937 5 2937 2937 5 2937
