a comparison of simulation event list algorithms four algorithms are considered which can be used to schedule events in a general purpose discrete simulation system two of the algorithms are new one is based on an end order tree structure for event notices and another uses an indexed linear list the algorithms are tested with a set of typical stochastic scheduling distributions especially chosen to show the advantages and limitations of the algorithms the end order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous immediate replacement for the algorithm in use with current simulation languages the most promising algorithm uses the indexed list concept it will require an adaptive routine before it can be employed in general purpose simulators but its performance is such that further study would be fruitful cacm april 1975 vaucher j g duval p simulation time flow mechanisms event list algorithm simulation time flow mechanisms event list algorithm simulation executive event scheduling routine discrete system simulation sorting 3 74 4 22 8 1 ca750410 jb january 9 1978 3 43 pm 2767 4 2767 3064 4 2767 1939 5 2767 2767 5 2767 2767 5 2767 2767 5 2767 2844 5 2767 2936 5 2767 3051 5 2767 3064 5 2767 3109 5 2767 970 6 2767 1059 6 2767 1846 6 2767 1939 6 2767 2742 6 2767 2742 6 2767 2742 6 2767 2767 6 2767 2767 6 2767 2767 6 2767 2767 6 2767 2767 6 2767 2844 6 2767 2844 6 2767 2936 6 2767
