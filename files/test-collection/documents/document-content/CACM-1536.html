dynamic computation of derivatives it is shown how wengert s procedure for computation of derivatives can be implemented conveniently by use of compiler generated complex addition subtraction and linkage to complex arithmetic subroutines evaluation of a function and derivative proceed in parallel as in wengert s procedure but with the imaginary parts of variables declared complex bearing the values of the derivatives of the real parts this technique provides a simple way to compute the derivatives of a function without the need for deriving and programming the evaluation of explicit formulas for the derivatives cacm september 1967 lesk a m ca670908 jb february 27 1978 3 11 pm 1028 4 1536 1216 4 1536 1278 4 1536 1347 4 1536 1396 4 1536 1536 4 1536 1029 5 1536 1536 5 1536 1536 5 1536 1536 5 1536
