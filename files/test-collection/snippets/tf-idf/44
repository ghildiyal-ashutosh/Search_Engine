a multiuser computation facility for education and research

present-day computing facilities are limited
in their value for scientific research by inability 
to interact strongly with users.  the full power of a
research computing instrument should be available 
at many terminals that give each user the ability to generate,
correct and operate any procedure he wishes, 
either simple or complex.  implementation is described

analysis of design alternatives for virtual memory indexes

a class of index structures for use in a virtual
memory environment is described.  design alternatives 
within this class of index structures are analyzed.  these
alternatives include a choice of search strategy, 
whether or not pages in the index are structured, and
whether or not keys are compressed.  the average 
cost of retrieving entries from these indexes is expressed
as a wieghted sum of the cost of a basic key 
comparison and the cost of crossing a page boundary in
the index structure.  formulas for the retrieval 
costs for possible combinations of design alternatives
are given.  these are used in numerical case studies 
which compare the retrieval costs of the alternatives.

index ranges for matrix calculi

the paper describes a scheme for symbolic
manipulation of index expressions which arise as 
a by-product of the symbolic manipulation of expressions
in the matrix calculi described by the authors 
in a previous paper.  this scheme attempts program optimization
by transforming the original algorithm 
rather than the machine code.  the goal is to automatically
generate code for handling the tedious address 
calculations necessitated by complicated data structures.
 the paper is therefore preoccupied with "indexing 
by position."  the relationship of "indexing by
name" and "indexing by position" is discussed.

exists within the file, then this strategy results in shallow
trees with fast access times.  the performance

establishment of the acm repository and principles
of the ir system applied to its operation

the history of the establishment of the acm repository
at the moore school, university of pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly.  two principles are presented as
paramount in the provision of information services: 
(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value 
of service exceeding user costs.  these principles serve
as guides in mechanizing the acm repository. 
 the main features of the information system are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search

and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  the first contribution
to the acm repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  these
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
the catalog is scheduled to appear in computing reviews.

a software design and evaluation system

a critical failure of current software system
design and implementation methodology is that 
the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented.  in this paper 
the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed.  a system which integrates performance evaluation
with design and implementation is described. 
 this system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  the source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines.  using the performance
information obtained from these

a record and file partitioning model

one of the main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  this paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable
length data-items.  the probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
the file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  one of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  the model that is presented in 
this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and
a mixed integer programming model, is a very general 
one; several types of file systems may be derived from
it by an appropriate selection of its parameters.

certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies

as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  to main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must

general performance analysis of key-to-address
transformation methods using an abstract file 
concept

this paper presents a new approach to the analysis
of performance of the various key-to-address 
transformation methods.  in this approach the keys in
a file are assumed to have been selected from the 
key space according to a certain probabilistic selection
algorithm.  all files with the same number of 
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance with the algorithm, and the 
average performance of the transformation methods on
these files will be used as the potential of these 
methods.  using this analysis, methods with the same overall
performance can be classified and key distributions 
partial to certain transformations can be identified.
 all this can be done analytically.  the approach 
is applied to a group of transformation methods
using files whose keys are selected randomly.

multi-attribute retrieval with combined indexes

in this paper a file organization scheme designed to
replace the use of the popular secondary index filing scheme
(or inverted files on secondary key fields) is described.
through the use of redundancy and storing 
keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations
of secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve
all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of
fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may
be used for many combinations of values and a combination of
buckets may be required for a given query.  the method which, in its
degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing
scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination
of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination
of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection
of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field
only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index
field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  redundancy, in some 
cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. in the general case, 
trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.

a mathematical model of a transaction-oriented
system under intermittent failures is proposed. 
 the system is assumed to operate with a checkpointing
and rollback/recovery method to ensure reliable 
information processing.  the model is used to derive the
principal performance measures, including

theoretical considerations in information retrieval systems

information storage

information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three 
************************
s are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  for identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by goffman, verhoeff and belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  for searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  the inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  one is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a

analysis and performance of inverted data base structures

the need to envision and architecture data base
systems in a hierarchical level by level framework 
is stressed. the inverted data base (file) organization
is then analyzed, considering implementation 
oriented aspects.  the inverted directory is viewed realistically
as another large data base which itself 
is subjected to inversion.  formulations are derived
to estimate average access time (read only) and 
storage requirements, formalizing the interaction of data
base content characteristics, logical complexity 
of queries, and machine timing and blocking specifications
identified as having a first-order effect 
on performance.  the formulations presented are necessary
to be used in conjunction with any index selection 
criteria to determine the optimum set of index keys.

a correctness proof of a topology information
main tenance protocol for a distributed computer 
network

in order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  one of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  the topology
information protocol that was implemented on the 
merit computer network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  it is based on baran's "hot
potato heuristic routing doctrine."  a correctness 
proof of this topology information protocol is also presented.

initial experience with an operating multiprogramming system

************************
 center has been using various
forms and degrees of program simultaneity 
in the operation of its modified sperry-rand univac scientific
model 1103 computer during the last five 
years.  this simultaneity has evolved from an initial
achievement of self-searching input and output 
to the automatic time sharing of independently coded
problems.  several important machine and program 
system modifications were necessary to accomplish this
evolution.  several additional modifications, 
although not required, were added to facilitate ease
of coding and operation.  all modifications had 
to proceed at a relatively temperate pace to insure that
the basic data-reduction work load of the computing 
center was completed on schedule.  some educationally
valuable mistakes were made, and their suggested 
cures often pointed the way to useful future improvements
or emphasized some of the basic principles 
of a multiprogramming system.  the material that follows
is a description of the evolution of the programming 
and hardware system which has developed into the present
multiprogramming system at lewis research center.
