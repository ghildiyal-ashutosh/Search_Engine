secure communications over insecure channels

according to traditional conceptions of cryptographic
security, it is necessary to transmit 
a key, by secret means, before encrypted messages can
be sent securely.  this paper shows that it is 
possible to select a key over open communications channels
in such a fashion that communications security 
can be maintained.  a method is described which forces
any enemy to expend an amount of work which increases 
as the square of the work required of the two communicants
to select the key.  the method provides a 
logically new kind of protection against the passive
eaves dropper.  it suggests that further research 
on this topic will be highly rewarding, both
in a theoretical and a practical sense.

an application of formac

a nonlinear circuit analysis problem is stated
and the way in which it was solved using formac 
is indicated.  the solution of the problem using formac
was notable since several other methods that 
were tried failed.  the problem is straightforward (although
untenable by hand) but nevertheless involved 
an elaborate use of the formac language.  the program
was fairly large and utilized practically every 
command.  in particular, it made extensive use of the
part command.  several tricks were necessary in 
order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the
formac system.  this paper is more concerned with 
the use of programming techniques in formac than with
the actual engineering problem, although readers

improved event-scanning mechanisms for discrete event simulation

future event lists in discrete event simulations. 
 there models are presented, all of which improve in effectiveness

a general business-oriented language based on decision expressions*

the structure of a digital compute programming
language which covers a wide class of business 
and file processing applications is presented.  such
a structure, based on identifying and incorporating 
into a compiler the aspects common to all processes
of such class, permits writing extremely compact 
programs, even for comparatively complex applications,
in terms of tables of control expressions which 
express only information characteristic of the particular
application.  furthermore,local changes of 
a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output
files involved) can be effected by local modifications 
in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the
tables).  this structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes. 
 the approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  it stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 it relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are no control 
statements such as go to, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one

synchronization with eventcounts and sequencers

synchronization of concurrent processes requires controlling the relative

a new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using

to control the ordering of events directly, rather than using mutual
exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control
ordering of events.  direct control of ordering seems to simplify
correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed
systems.  the mechanism is defined formally, and then several

on the complexity of lr(k) testing

the problem of determining whether an arbitrary
context-free grammar is a member of some easily 
parsed subclass of grammars such as the lr(k) grammars
is considered.  the time complexity of this problem 
is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed
integer and when k is considered to be a parameter 
of the test.  in the first case, it is shown that for
every k there exists an o(n(k+2)) algorithm for 
testing the lr(k) property, where n is the size of the
grammar in question.  on the other hand, if both 
k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then
the complexity of the problem depends very strongly 
on the representation chosen for k.  more specifically,
it is shown that this problem is np-complete 
when k is expressed

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk 
************************
 allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  finally, problem

adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary

to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  the form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  the modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  simulation results are presented 
which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.

logic and programming languages

logic has been long in terested in whether answers
to certain questions are computable in principle, 
since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of
formalization.  more recently, precise comparisons 
in the efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 these, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  what is a machine?
 what is a computable process?  how (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 the definition of 
************************
. 
 the definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 so far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  it would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  these levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.

a language extension for expressing constraints on data access

controlled sharing of information is needed and
desirable for many applications and is supported 
in operating systems by access control mechanisms.  this
paper shows how to extend programming languages 
to provide controlled sharing.  the extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 the constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 the approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.

the allocation of computer resources-is pricing the answer?

the widespread use of complex third generation computing systems has led to a 
much broader concern about the means by which the resources of these systems
are allocated among the user community.  one means that is suggested
more and more frequently is a pricing procedure.  in this
paper the manner in which one would like to allocate computing resources
is considered, and then the extent to which a pricing mechanism fits this mold 
is discussed.  inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at 
times, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted 
flexibly in order to make a dynamic allocation of resources.  consideration is 
also given to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful 
effects of frequent price fluctuations.  although the subject of pricing has
been given a lot of attention recently, a number of misconceptions
persist about its purpose and its operation.  an attempt is made to clarify 
some of these misunderstandings and to highlight the advantages and 
disadvantages and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of pricing. two
illustrative pricing systems are also discussed in order to demonstrate the 
applicability of pricing in quite different environments.

a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems

an encryption method is presented with the novel
property that publicly revealing an encryption 
key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key.  this has two important consequences: (1) 
couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit
keys, since a message can be enciphered using 
an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient.
 only he can decipher the message, since 
only he knows the corresponding decryption key.  (2)
a message can be "signed" using a privately held 
decryption key.  anyone can verify this signature using
the corresponding publicly revealed encryption 
key.  signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot
later deny the validity of his signature.  this 
has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic
funds transfer" systems.  a message is 
encrypted by representing it as a number m, raising
m to a publicly specified power e, and then taking 
the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly
specified product, n, of two large secret prime 
numbers p and q.  decryption is similar;only a different,
secret, power d is used, where e * d = 1 (mod(p-1) 
* (q-1)).  the security of the system rests in part on
the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, 
n.

coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made

framework,the requirements specified are applicable
to the design of advanced programming systems for 
a wide range of applications.  three aspects of programming
systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,

a new algorithm for global flow analysis on

 for a graph of e edges, the algorithm has a 
worst case time bound of o(e log e) function operations.
 it is also shown that in programming terms, 
the number of operations is proportional to e plus the
number of exits from program loops.  consequently

an improved algorithm for decentralized extrema-finding
in circular configurations of processes

this note presents an improvement to lelann's
algorithm for finding the largest (or smallest) of a set of uniquely
numbered processes arranged in a circle, in which no central
controller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori.
this decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective

experiments with the m & n tree-searching program

the m & n procedure is an improvement to the mini-max
backing-up procedure widely used in computer program for game-playing
and other purposes.  it is based on the principle that it is
desirable to have many options when making decisions in the face of
uncertainty.  the mini-max procedure assigns to a max (min) node
the value of the highest (lowest) valued successor to that node. 
the m & n procedure assigns to a max (min) node some function of
the m (n) highest (lowest) valued successors.  an m & n procedure was
written in lisp to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that 
the m & n procedure is significantly superior to the mini-max
procedure.  the statistical significance of important conclusions is given. 
since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers 
on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field, these experiments 
can perhaps serve as a model for future work.

 as it was found that successive improvements to

each trip around.  the degree of physical separation

a model and stack implementation of multiple environments

many control and access environment structures
require that storage for a procedure activation 
exist at times when control is not nested within the
procedure activated.  this is straightforward to 
implement by dynamic storage allocation with linked
blocks for each activation, but rather expensive 
in both time and space.  this paper presents an implementation
technique using a single stack to hold 
procedure activation storage which allows retention
of that storage for durations not necessarily tied 
to control flow.  the technique has the property that,
in the simple case,it runs identically to the 
usual automatic stack allocation and deallocation procedure.
 applications of this technique to multitasking, 
coroutines, backtracking, label-valued variables, and
functional arguments are discussed.  in the initial

 in clu

clu is a new programming language designed to support
the use of abstractions in program construction. 
 work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 clu provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  this paper provides an in troduction
to the abstraction mechanisms in clu.  by 
means of programming examples, the utility of the

studies in machine cognition using the game of poker

a progress report is presented of on-going
research efforts concerning human decision making 
under uncertainly and risk and human problem solving
and learning processes on the one hand, and 
************************
 on the one hand, and machine 
learning, large scale programming systems, and novel
programming techniques on the other.  there has 
also been in terest in how humans make deductive and inductive
inferences and form and optimize heuristic 
rules, and how machines can reach similar results.
 although the vehicle of these investigations has 
been the game of poker, a conceptual framework has been
provided that should have a fairly wide range 
of applicability.  the models of human judgment, choice,
and decision making are incorporated in a large 
scale complex program.  they represent both descriptive
and normative theories of behavior. an in teractive 
game environment has been recently established

a program for the syntactic analysis of english sentences

a program is described which produces syntactic
analyses of english sentences with respect 
to a transformational grammar.  the main features of the
analyzer are that it uses only a limited dictionary 
of english words and that it pursues all analysis paths
simultaneously while processing the sentence 
from left to right.  the form of representation used
for the dictionary and the grammar is indicated 
and an outline account is given of the analysis procedure.
 techniques for keeping the size of the analysis 
record within reasonable limits and for avoiding the need
for dynamic application of certain transformational 
rules are described.   a number of examples of output

machine controls for analysis of variance

a major problem in using the analysis of variance,
as the number of factors increases, is the 
exponential rise in the number of interactions.  even
though the experimenter may not be interested in 
these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in
most experimental designs because of the problem 
of getting error terms.  it is natural therefore to look
to the computer to handle the bulk of work involved 
in computing

the structure of programming languages

the following are identified as major components
of every programming language: (1) the elementary 
program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking elementary
statements together, (3) the means by which 
a program can obtain data inputs.  several alternative
forms of each of these components are described, 
compared and evaluated.  many examples, frequently from

in order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each 
************************
 to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  one of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  the topology
information protocol that was implemented on the 
merit computer network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  it is based on baran's "hot
potato heuristic routing doctrine."  a correctness 
proof of this topology information protocol is also presented.

event manipulation for discrete simulations
requiring large numbers of events

the event-manipulation system presented here consists of
two major parts.  the first part addresses 
the familiar problem of event scheduling efficiency
when the number of scheduled events grows large. 
 the second part deals with the less apparent problem
of providing efficiency and flexibility as scheduled 
events are accessed to be executed.  additional features
and problems dealt with include the proper handling 
of simultaneous events; that certain events must be created,
scheduled, and executed at the same points 
in simulated time; that infinite loops caused by the concatenation
of such "zero-time" events are possible 
and must be diagnosed; that maintaining various event
counts is practical and economical; and that a 
capability for handling  "time-displaceable" events is desirable and possible.

a deductive question-answer for natural language inference

the question-answering aspects of the protosynthex iii pro
totype language processing system are described and exemplified in
detail.  the system is written in lisp 1.5 and operates on the q-32
time-sharing system.  the system's data structures and their semantic
organization, the deductive question-answering formalism of
relational properties and complex-relation-forming operators, and
the question-answering procedures which employ these features in
their operation are all described and illustrated.  examples of the
system's performance and of the limitations of its question-answering 
capability are presented and discussed.  it is shown that the
use of semantic information in deductive question answering greatly 
facilitates the process, and that a top-down procedure which works

pattern width at a given angle

that the pattern feature "width as a function
of angle" possesses several possible interpretations 
is demonstrated in this paper, which is a review of
the width concept in pattern recognition and the 
geometrical concept itself.  the object of the work
is to clarify how the word description can be made 
precise so that computer algorithms for feature extraction
may be obtained; the focus is on the theoretical 
subject matter.  the results consist of a set-theoretic
definition of width-at-angle, a theorem relating 
it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions
of alternate widths.
