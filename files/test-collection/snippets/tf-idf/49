effective information retrieval using term accuracy

************************
 systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  in the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  the concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  by relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

a vector space model for automatic indexing

in a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  an approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model.

subexpression ordering in the execution of arithmetic expressions

an arithmetic expression can often be broken
down into its component subexpressions.  depending 
on the hardware environment in which the expression is
to be executed, these subexpressions can be evaluated 
in serials, in parallel, or in a combination of these
modes.  this paper shows that expression execution 
time can be minimized only if consideration is given to
the ordering of the subexpressions.  in particular, 
subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing
memory and processor time requirements.  this 
observation is valid for configurations ranging from
a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to 
multiprocessor with a "cache" buffer memory.  if the
number of subexpressions which can be executed in

a stochastic evaluation model for database
organization in data retrieval systems

experimental work in the valuation of large
scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due 
to its difficulty and prohibitive cost. this paper
discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval 
system which has the effect of significantly reducing
the cost of experimentation and enabling research 
never attempted before.  the model is designed to estimate
the retrieval workload of alternative data 
retrieval systems.  these data retrieval systems can
be organized under several database organizations, 
including inverted list, threaded list, and cellular
list organizations and hybrid combinations of these 
systems.  effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated
by using the model to study the effect of 
database organizations in data retrieval systems.  in particular,
the impact of query complexity is analyzed.

canonical structure in attribute based file organization

a new file structure for attribute based retrieval
is proposed in this paper.  it allows queries 
involving arbitrary boolean functions of the attribute-value
pairs to be processed without taking intersections 
of lists.  the structure is highly dependent on the
way in which the file is to be used and is uniquely 
determined by the specification of the allowed queries.
 thus, for example, the structure for retrieval 
on the basis of ranges of values of a given attribute would
be very different from one where only retrieval 
on the basis of a single value is permitted.  the file
organization being proposed is based on the atoms 
of a boolean algebra generated by the queries.  the desirable
properties claimed for this structure are 
proved, and file maintenance questions are discussed.

an affirmative partial answer is provided to
the question of whether it is possible to program 
parallel-processor computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems.  parallel-processor 
systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of
the processors can simultaneously execute 
************************
 can simultaneously execute separate 
tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease
the solution time of a computational problem. the 
processors have independent instruction counters, meaning
that each processor executes its own task program 
relatively independently of the other processors.  communication
between cooperating processors is by 
means of data in storage shared by all processors.  a
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
parallel-processor computing 
************************
-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.  the data gathered from
simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution 
of this problem, typical of a large class of important
problems.  it is shown that, with proper programming, 
solution time when n processors are applied approaches
1/n times the solution time for a single processor, 
while improper programming can actually lead to an increase
of solution time with the number of processors. 
 stability of the method of solution was also investigated.

a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  the use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  in this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

consisting of the textual string desired and strings
delimiting the context in which the hit is to be

than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  the members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.
the rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages.

 from files

a generalized file structure is provided
by which the concepts of keyword, index, record, file, directory,
file structure, directory decoding, and record retrieval are defined
and from which some of the frequently used file structures such
as inverted files, index-sequential files, and multilist files are
derived.  two algorithms which retrieve records from the generalized file 
structure are presented.

 operations.  the data storage
hardware is assumed to consist on n-levels of 
linearly connected memory hardware with increasing data
access times and increasing data storage capabilities. 
 a system might, for example, consist of fast semiconductor
memory, computer core memory, extended core 
storage, disk memory, and data cells.  equations are derived
to predict the effect of such a system on 
data access times using sequential files, random access files,
and structured files employing multiple-hierarchical 
linked lists.

a note on information organization and storage

since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 a general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  there are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  the use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 the results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

codas: a data display system

codas, a customer oriented data system, is
a user-oriented data retrieval and display system. 
 the command language of the system provides the user
with an easy means for specifying data retrieval 
and display requests.  data is displayed as tables and
graphs produced in a format ready for publication. 
 in this paper the statements of the request language
and the general system design are described.

synchronizing processors with memory-content-generated interrupts

implementations of the "lock-unlock" method
of synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor 
system usually require uninterruptable, memory-pause type instructions.
 an interlock scheme called read-interlock, 
which does not require memory-pause instructions, has
been developed for a dual dec pdp-10 system with 
real-time requirements.  the read-interlock method does
require a special"read-interlock" instruction 
in the repertoire of the processors and a special "read-interlock"
cycle in the repertoire of the memory 
modules.  when a processor examines a "lock" (a memory
location) with a read-interlock instruction, it 
will be interrupted if the lock was already set; examining
a lock immediately sets it if it was not already 
set (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle). 
writing into a lock clears it.  having the processor 
interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of
branching is advantageous if the branch would have 
resulted in an effective interrupt.
