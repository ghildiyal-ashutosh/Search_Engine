compressed tries

this paper presents a new data structure,
called a compressed trie or c-trie, to be used in 
information retrieval systems.  it has the 
************************
 systems.  it has the same underlying
m-ary tree structure as a trie, where m is 
a parameter of the trie, but whereas the fields of the
nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold 
a key or at least a pointer, the fields in a c-trie are
only one bit long.  in the analysis part of the 
paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the
retrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections 
of one key, is of the order logm(n) and the storage
requirement of the order n*(m+log2 n) bits.  this 
improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time
is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility 
of the structure, and therefore updating costs are increased.
 first the c-trie is analyzed as a data 
structure, and then several methods of its use

a fast string searching algorithm

an algorithm is presented that searches for
the location, "i," of the first occurrence of a 
character string, "pat," in another string, "string."
 during the search operation, the characters of 
pat are matched starting with the last character of
pat.  the information gained by starting the match 
at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm
to proceed in large jumps through the text being 
searched.  thus the algorithm has the unusual property that,
in most cases, not all of the first i characters 
of string are inspected.  the number of characters actually
inspected (on the average) decreases as a 
function of the length of pat.  for a random english
pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically 
inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at
i.  furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented 
so that (on the average) fewer than i+patlen machine
instructions are executed.  these conclusions are 
supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical
analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm. 
 the worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in
i+patlen, assuming the availability of array space 
for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet.

algorithmic selection of the best
method for compressing map data strings

the best of a dozen different methods for
compressing map data is illustrated.  the choices 
are generated by encoding data strings-sequence of like
codes-by three methods and in four directions. 
 relationships are developed between compression alternatives
to avoid comparing all of them.  the technique 
has been used to compress data from forest resource maps,
but is widely applicable to map and photographic

an application of heuristic search methods to edge and contour 
************************
 to edge and contour detection

this paper presents a method for detecting edges
and contours in noisy pictures.  the properties 
of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge
detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing 
the given figure of merit.  this problem can be represented
as a shortest path problem on a graph and 
can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms.
 the relations between this representation of 
the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach
are discussed, showing that the graph search 
method can lead to substantial improvements in computing
time.  moreover, if heuristic search methods 
are used, the computing 
************************
 
are used, the computing time will depend on the amount
of noise in the picture.  some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the separation 
of touching objects.

space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errors

in this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors
a given set of messages.  two new hash-coding methods are examined
and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method.
the computational factors considered are the size of the hash area
(space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the 
given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.  the new methods 
are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded 
information from that associated 
************************
 from that associated with conventional methods.  the reduction in 
space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of 
errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, 
applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident
hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  in such 
applications, it is envisaged that overall performance
could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in
conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some
secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small
fraction of errors associated with new methods.  an example is discussed
which illustrates possible areas of application for the new
methods.  analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing
a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as
members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash
area to be used without increasing reject time.

interpolation search -a log logn search

interpolation search is a method of retrieving
a desired record by key in an ordered file by 
using the value of the key and the statistical distribution
of the keys.  it is shown that on the average 
log logn file accesses are required to retrieve a key,
assuming that the n keys are uniformly distributed. 
 the number of extra accesses is also estimated and shown
to be very low.  the same holds if the cumulative 
distribution function of the keys is known.  computational
experiments confirm these results.

************************

ways.  much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  in the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  the concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  by relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase

a model for automating file and program design in business application systems

this paper discusses a model for finding an efficient implementation of a 
business application system whose logical specifications have been determined
in advance.  the model views file and program design as a problem
of systematically coordinating the configurations of datasets and
computations.  it uses a straight forward search technique to
determine aggregations of computations, aggregations of datasets, device,
organization, and key order for each data set, key order for
 each computation, and access method  for each dataset-computation
pair.  although computational results are presented for a sample
problem involving 54 computations and 49 datasets, the main point of
the paper is that the underlying model works computationally an
d is simple enough to be adapted to many file design situations.

establishment of the acm repository and principles
of the ir system applied to its operation

the history of the establishment of the acm repository
at the moore school, university of pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly.  two principles are presented as
paramount in the provision of information services: 
(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value 
of service exceeding user costs.  these principles serve
as guides in mechanizing the acm repository. 
 the main features of the information system are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  the first contribution
to the acm repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  these
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
the catalog is scheduled to appear in computing reviews.
 the indexing system is described in detail. 
 the main catalog is used to describe the documents,
and inverted lists are provided by the repository 
system for retrieval by concept coordination.

************************
 for automatic indexing

in a document retrieval, or other pattern matching
environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns
(search requests), it appears that the best indexing 
(property) space is one where each entity lies as far away
from the others as possible; in these circumstances 
the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  an approach based on 
space density computations is used to choose an optimum
indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating
the usefulness of the model.

median split trees: a fast lookup technique for frequently occuring keys

split trees are a new technique for searching sets
of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions. 
 a split tree is a binary search tree each node of which
contains two key values-a node value which is 
a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split
value which partitions the remaining keys (with 
respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and
right subtrees.  a median split tree (mst) uses 
the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split
value to force the search tree to be perfectly 
balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation
of the tree and high search speed.  unlike 
frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a
successful search of an mst is log n bounded and 
very stable around minimal values.  further, an mst
can be built for a given key ordering and set of 
frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n2 for an
optimum binary search tree.  a discussion of the 
application of mst's to dictionary lookup for english is
presented, and the performance obtained is contrasted 
with that of other techniques.

canonical structure in attribute based file organization

a new file structure for attribute based retrieval
is proposed in this paper.  it allows queries 
involving arbitrary boolean functions of the attribute-value
pairs to be processed without taking intersections 
of lists.  the structure is highly dependent on the
way in which the file is to be used and is uniquely 
determined by the specification of the allowed queries.
 thus, for example, the structure for retrieval 
on the basis of ranges of values of a given attribute would
be very different from one where only retrieval 
on the basis of a single value is permitted.  the file
organization being proposed is based on the atoms 
of a boolean algebra generated by the queries.  the desirable
properties claimed for this structure are 
proved, and file maintenance questions are discussed.

of searches), o (n log n).  search algorithms 
are given for partial match queries with t keys specified

file organization: the consecutive retrieval property

the consecutive retrieval property is an important
relation between a query set and record 
set.  its existence enables the design of an information
retrieval system with a minimal search time 
and no redundant storage.  some important theorems on
the consecutive retrieval property are proved in 
this paper.  conditions under which the consecutive retrieval
property exists and remain invariant have 
been established.  an outline for designing an information
retrieval system based on the consecutive 
retrieval property is also discussed.

a record and file partitioning model

a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  this paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable

length data-items.  the probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
the file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  one of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  the model that is presented in

general performance analysis of key-to-address
transformation methods using an abstract file 
concept

this paper presents a new approach to the analysis
of performance of the various key-to-address 
transformation methods.  in this approach the keys in
a file are assumed to have been selected from the 
key space according to a certain probabilistic selection
algorithm.  all files with the same number of 
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance with the algorithm, and the 
average performance of the transformation methods on
these files will be used as the potential of these 
methods.  using this analysis, methods with the same overall
performance can be classified and key distributions 
partial to certain transformations can be identified.
 all this can be done analytically.  the approach 
is applied to a group of transformation methods
using files whose keys are selected randomly.

the use of normal multiplication tables
for information storage and retrieval

this paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute

for the information system.  algorithms for the organization an
d retrieval of information are described.  this method is particularly
suitable for queries requesting a group of information items,
 all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly
some other attributes as well).  several examples are given; the
results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space
are compared to other common approaches.  algorithms evaluating
the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system
are described.  for a certain class of information systems,
the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval
with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems.  
moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted

a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrieval
theorem for associative memories

an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  the use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the 
************************

of the word length.)  in this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

retrieval, namely, the maintenance 
************************
, namely, the maintenance and use of large 
dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only
infrequently.  a novel method is presented, which 
maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution.  this is

 this method treats text as a string of characters rather
than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  the members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.
the rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages.
