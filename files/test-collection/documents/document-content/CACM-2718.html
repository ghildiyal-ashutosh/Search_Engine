a preliminary system for the design of dbtg data structures the functional approach to database design is introduced in this approach the goal of design is to derive a data structure which is capable of supporting a set of anticipated queries rather than a structure which models the business in some other way an operational computer program is described which utilizers the functional approach to design data structures conforming to the data base task group specifications the automatic programming technology utilized by this program although typically used to generate procedure is here used to generate declaratives cacm october 1975 gerritsen r network model of databases data base task group database design data structure automatic programming translation nonprocedural languages 3 5 3 64 3 7 4 2 5 23 ca751001 jb january 6 1978 2 02 pm 2155 4 2718 2406 4 2718 2710 4 2718 2715 4 2718 2716 4 2718 2717 4 2718 2718 4 2718 2765 4 2718 2817 4 2718 2888 4 2718 2901 4 2718 2957 4 2718 2959 4 2718 2965 4 2718 3087 4 2718 3154 4 2718 2046 5 2718 2718 5 2718 2718 5 2718 2718 5 2718 3147 5 2718 2718 6 2718
