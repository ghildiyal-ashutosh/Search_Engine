a microprogrammed implementation of euler on ibm system 360 model 30 an experimental processing system for the algorithmic language euler has been implemented in microprogramming on an ibm system 360 model 30 using a second read only storage unit the system consists of a microprogrammed compiler and a microprogrammed string language interpreter and of an i o control program written in 360 machine language the system is described and results are given in terms of microprogram and main storage space required and compiler and interpreter performance obtained the role of microprogramming is stressed which opens a new dimension in the processing of interpretive code the structure and content of a higher level language can be matched by an appropriate interpretive language which can be executed efficiently by microprograms on existing computer hardware cacm september 1967 weber h ca670904 jb february 27 1978 3 44 pm 1542 4 1542 1542 4 1542 1683 4 1542 1693 4 1542 1781 4 1542 1787 4 1542 1836 4 1542 1945 4 1542 2060 4 1542 2061 4 1542 2082 4 1542 2091 4 1542 2152 4 1542 2179 4 1542 2340 4 1542 2356 4 1542 2546 4 1542 2603 4 1542 2698 4 1542 2708 4 1542 2824 4 1542 2982 4 1542 2986 4 1542 3045 4 1542 3093 4 1542 1491 5 1542 1542 5 1542 1542 5 1542 1542 5 1542 2202 5 1542 2527 5 1542 3198 5 1542 1542 6 1542 1542 6 1542
