experimental evaluation of information retrieval through a teletypewriter experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of mechanized information retrieval systems with emphasis on interactive man machine language and on some of the mechanical and psychological limitations in their design were conducted at the moore school information systems laboratory the basic assumption of the research is that an information retrieval system that provides for man machine dialogue at a remote inquiry terminal should provide a searcher with many of the tools which would be available to him were he actually performing his search at a library or repository of documents factors involved in evaluation of such a system include ease of use learning time and effectiveness of actual retrieval three experiments and the conclusions resulting from them are detailed cacm september 1968 rubinoff m bergman s franks w rubinoff e information retrieval testing information system evaluation experimental document retrieval document retrieval document perusal man machine communication remote console communication teletypewriter communication remote terminal communication retrieval command language symbolic command language interactive systems user learning factors on line searching 3 72 3 74 3 79 3 81 ca680902 jb february 22 1978 9 30 am 1155 4 1699 1456 4 1699 1468 4 1699 1515 4 1699 1681 4 1699 1699 4 1699 1699 4 1699 1699 4 1699 1856 4 1699 2127 4 1699 1194 5 1699 1324 5 1699 1681 5 1699 1699 5 1699 1699 5 1699 1699 5 1699
