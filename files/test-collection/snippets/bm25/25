protection in operating systems

a model of protection 
************************


a model of protection mechanisms in computing
systems is presented and its 
************************
 is presented and its appropriateness 
is argued.  the "safety" problem for protection systems
under this model is to determine in a given situation 
whether a subject can acquire a particular right to
an object.   in restricted cases, it can be shown 
that this problem is decidable, i.e. there is an algorithm
to determine whether a system in a particular 
configuration is safe.  in general, and under surprisingly
weak assumptions, it cannot be decided if 
a situation is safe. various implications of this fact are discussed.

an overview of the ispl computer system design

this paper explores the advantages of the concurrent
design of the language, operating system, 
and machine (via microcode) to create an interactive programming
laboratory.  it describes the synergistic 
effect that the freedom to move and alter features from
one of these domains to another has had on the 
design of this system (which has not been implemented).
 this freedom simplified both incremental compilation 
and the system's addressing structure, and centralized the
communication mechanisms enabling the construction 
of hierarchical subsystems.  it also suggested

new concept for operating systems: separation

of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource
allocation. this separation enables incorporation 
of new scheduling algorithms (decision of what to do) without
endangering the system integration (correctly 
performing the scheduling decisions).

considerations in the design of a multiple
computer system with extended core storage

the use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  the general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual cdc 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  in the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 an observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

on the implementation of security measures in information systems

the security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  a set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  the model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.

management utilization of computers in american local governments

traditional concepts of management information
systems (mis) bear little relation to the information 
systems currently in use by top management in most us local

computing, involving the use of relatively unsophisticated
applications.  despite the unsophisticated 
nature of these systems, management use of computing is
surprisingly common, but also varied in its extent 
among local governments.  management computing is most
prevalent in those governments with professional 
management practices where top management is supportive

synchronization with eventcounts and sequencers

synchronization of concurrent processes requires controlling the relative 
ordering of events in the processes.
a new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using 
abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processes
to control the ordering of events directly, rather than using mutual
exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control
ordering of events.  direct control of ordering seems to simplify
correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed
systems.  the mechanism is defined 
************************
.  the mechanism is defined formally, and then several
examples of its use are given.  the relationship of the mechanism
to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular,
eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement
of information matters.  an implementation of eventcount
s and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described.

the design, implementation, and evaluation of a working set dispatcher

the behavior of a computer system is largely
dependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate 
the system resources to the processes competing for them.
 recent research in time-sharing paging systems 
has developed the working set model for program behavior,
and are source allocation strategy based on 
this model has been proposed.  two implementations
along these principles have been reported, but it 
seems that in neither case have further results been
announced.  this report discusses the design and 
implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set
principle, presents data to permit analysis of 
its behavior, and indicates future directions of research
on methods of controlling a computer system.

joining policies in a multipriority multiclass batch computer system

consider a multipriority batch computer system
which users from several different classes may 
join, its toll, service, and waiting charges.  such a
system is formulated here as a semi-markov decision 
process, in which the aim of arriving users is to minimize
their expected loss.  the optimal joining 
policy is one of arriving users who may join the system
at some of its queues is a control limit policy, 
with a single control number for any possible queue
and the user's class; a newly arriving user will 
join a queue that is not filled up to the control number
corresponding to this queue and the user's class. 
 in this paper control numbers, as well as lower and upper
bounds for the control numbers and the capacities 
of the system's queues, are derived.

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at 
************************
 sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

the structure of programming languages

elementary program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking
elementary statements together, (3) the means 
by which a program can obtain data inputs.  several
alternative forms of each of these components are 
also described, compared and evaluated.  many examples,
frequently from list processing languages, illustrate 
the forms described.  the advantages, disadvantages and
factors influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language are discussed, and the paper concludes
with the suggestion that programming languages 
evolve toward one which will permit all the most convenient
ways of structuring programs, organizing 
systems and referencing data.

performance is quite insensitive to skewed distributions,
and second, its worst-case complexity is o(

tests conducted to estimate the average

the allocation of computer resources-is pricing the answer?

the widespread use of complex third generation computing systems has led to a 
much broader concern about the means by which the resources of these systems
are allocated among the user community.  one means that is suggested
more and more frequently is a pricing procedure.  in this
paper the manner in which one would like to allocate computing resources
is considered, and then the extent to which a pricing mechanism fits this mold 
is discussed.  inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at 
times, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted 
flexibly in order to make a dynamic allocation of resources.  consideration is 
also given to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful 
effects of frequent price fluctuations.  although the subject of pricing has
been given a lot of attention recently, a number of misconceptions
persist about its purpose and its operation.  an attempt is made to clarify 
some of these misunderstandings and to highlight the advantages and 
disadvantages and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of pricing. two
illustrative pricing systems are also discussed in order to demonstrate the 
applicability of pricing in quite different environments.

requirements for advanced programming systems for list processing

list processing systems should be designed to
facilitate production of large programs to manipulate 
large complex symbolic data stores.  this paper presents
an overview of a number of system features which 
the author feels are important to improve the productivity
of programmers working in such domains.  a 
system view it taken, rather than focusing just on language
features, since algorithms must be not only 
coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made
efficient, and run on data.  because of this general 
framework,the requirements specified are applicable
to the design of advanced programming systems for 
a wide range of applications.  three aspects of programming
systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  interactive 
features 
************************
.  interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  the  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.  syntax directed
input and output of data would facilitate use of 
complex data stores.

 the system is used not only to simulate an actual operating

toward a discipline of real-time programming

programming is divided into three major categories
with increasing complexity of reasoning 
in program validation: sequential programming, multiprogramming,
and real-time programming.  by adhering 
to a strict programming discipline and by using a suitable
high-level language molded after this discipline, 
the complexity of reasoning about concurrency and execution
time constrain ts may be drastically reduced. 
 this may be the only practical way to make real-time
systems analytically verifiable

a hardware architecture for implementing protection rings

protection of computations and information
is an important aspect of a computer utility.  in 
a system which uses segmentation as a memory addressing
scheme, protection can be achieved in part by 
associating concentric rings of decreasing access privilege
with a computation.  this paper describes 
hardware processor mechanisms for implementing these rings
of protection.  the mechanisms for implementing 
these rings of protection. the mechanisms allow cross-ring
calls and subsequent returns to occur without 
trapping to the supervisor.  automatic hardware validation
of references across ring boundaries is also 
performed.  thus, a call by a user procedure to a protected
subsystem (including the supervisor) is identical 
to a call to a companion user procedure.  the mechanisms
of passing and referencing arguments are the 
same in both cases as well.

the design of the venus operating system

the venus operating system is an experimental
multiprogramming system which supports five or 
six concurrent users on a small computer.  the system was
produced to test the effect of machine architecture 
on complexity of software.  the system is defined by
a combination of microprograms and software.  the 
microprogram defines a machine with some unusual architectural
feature; the software exploits these features 
to define the operating system as simply as possible.
 in this paper the development of the system is 
described, with particular emphasis on the principles which guided the design.

estimates of distributions of random variables
for certain computer communications traffic models

a study of multiaccess computer communications has
characterized the distributions underlying an elementary
 model of the user-computer interactive process.  the model used is
elementary in the sense that many of the random variables that
generally are of interest in computer communications studies can be
decomposed into the elements of this model.  data were examined
from four operational multiaccess systems, and the model is shown to
be robust; that is each of the variables of the model has the
same distribution independent of which of the four systems is being examined. 
it is shown that the gamma distribution can be used to
describe the discrete variables.  approximations to the gamma distribution
by the exponential distribution are discussed for the systems studied.

introduced by dijkstra unless conditional 
statements are used.  an examination of patil's proof
shows that he has established this claim only under 
strong restrictions on the use of p and v.  these restrictions
eliminate programming techniques used

is "sometime" sometimes better than "always"? (intermittent
assertions in proving program correctness)

this paper explores a technique for proving the
correctness and termination of programs simultaneously. 
 this approach, the intermittent-assertion method, involves
documenting the program with assertions that 
must be true at some time when control passes through
the corresponding point, but that need not be true 
every time.  the method, introduced by burstall, promises
to provide a valuable complement to the more 
conventional methods.  the intermittent-assertion method
is presented with a number of examples of correctness 
and termination proofs.  some of these proofs are markedly
simpler than their conventional counterparts. 
 on the other hand, it is shown that a proof of correctness
or termination by any of the conventional 
techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using
intermittent assertions.  finally, it is shown 
how the intermittent-assertion method can be applied
to prove the validity of program transformations 
and the correctness of continuously operating programs.

the notions of consistency and predicate locks in a database system

in database systems, users access shared data
under the assumption that the data satisfies 
certain consistency constraints.  this paper defines the
concepts of transaction, consistency and schedule 
and shows that consistency requires that a transaction
cannot request new locks after releasing a lock. 
 then it is argued that a transaction needs to lock a logical
rather than a physical subset of the database. 
 these subsets may be specified by predicates.  an
implementation of predicate locks which satisfies 
the consistency condition is suggested.

dynamic verification of operating system decisions

dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  the dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the prime system
being designed and constructed at the university 
of california, berkeley.  prime is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 the technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  on prime,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

densities in a river using previously developed

of conditions in that river. although not totally 
accurate, the simulation was found to predict the general

a model and stack implementation of multiple environments

many control and access environment structures
require that storage for a procedure activation 
exist at times when control is not nested within the
procedure activated.  this is straightforward to 
implement by dynamic storage allocation with linked
blocks for each activation, but rather expensive 
in both time and space.  this paper presents an implementation
technique using a single stack to hold 
procedure activation storage which allows retention
of that storage for durations not necessarily tied 
to control flow.  the technique has the property that,
in the simple case,it runs identically to the 
usual automatic stack allocation and deallocation procedure.
 applications of this technique to multitasking, 
coroutines, backtracking, label-valued variables, and
functional arguments are discussed.  in the initial 
model, a single real processor is assumed, and the implementation
assumes multiple-processes coordinate 
by passing control explicitly to one another.  a multiprocessor
implementation requires only a few changes 
to the basic technique, as described.

a high security log-in procedure

the protection of time sharing systems from
unauthorized users is often achieved by the use 
of passwords.  by using one-way ciphers to code the passwords,
the risks involved with storing the passwords 
in the computer can be avoided.  we discuss the selection
of a suitable one-way cipher and suggest that 
for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus are
superior to one-way ciphers derived from sannon

effects of chargeout on user/manager attitudes

the relationship of in ternal pricing systems
for computer services (chargeout systems) and 
user management attitudes about their computer-based
information systems is investigated. evidence is 
provided that the relationship conforms to a general
pattern that would be expected from the hypothesis 
of the four stages of edp growth [15].  the results also
indicate that the chargeout systems characteristic 
of advanced edp stage environments are associated with
relatively high levels of positive user attitudes 
and marked increases in edp training for users. both factors
are important to the user/manager involvement 
necessary for effective control of computer-based systems.

 development and main tenance of computer-based 
systems is asserted to be a category of organizational
change.  a "felt need" for the change on the part 
of the user/manager is prerequisite to any change taking
place.  the research methods of behavioral science 
are applied to investigate the user/manager
environment and the effects of chargeout.

abstraction mechanisms in clu

clu is a new programming language designed to support
the use of abstractions in program construction. 
 work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data 
************************
, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 clu provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  this

to the abstraction mechanisms in clu.  by 
means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction 
is illustrated, and it is shown how clu programs may
be written to use and implement abstractions.  the 
clu library, which permits incremental program development
with complete type checking performed at compile 
time, is also discussed.

the data collected from the interpretive execution of

the frequency of page faults, i.e. the frequency of those

a page of data or instructions not in main (core) memory.
 these data are used also for the evaluation 
of page replacement algorithms and for assessing the
effects on performance of changes in the amount 
of storage allocated to executing programs.

an interactive command generating facility

a facility to permit conversationally controlled tasks
to be executed in a noninteractive environment is proposed.
a means by which programs can generate interactive time-sharing commands
and receive the corresponding output response is presented.  the commands 
will be invoked as if they had been typed at a console keyboard.  it is 
argued that this facility will help overcome some of the current limitations 
in man-computer communication. a set of functions to accomplish the above 
which could be embedded into any string processing language is suggested, 
and necessary information pertinent to implementation of the facility on 
existing time-sharing systems is given.

three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  these criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  to define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

a correctness proof of a topology information
main tenance protocol for a distributed computer 
network

in order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  one of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  the topology
information protocol that was implemented on the 
merit computer network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  it is based on baran's "hot
potato heuristic routing doctrine."  a correctness 
proof of this topology information protocol is also presented.

hydra-the kernel of an operating system for c.mmp,

generalized notion of "resource", both physical and virtual,
called an "object".  mechanisms are presented

for dealing with objects, including the creation of new
types, specification of new operations applicable

type of object.  the mechanisms provide a coherent 
basis for extension of the system in two directions: the
introduction of new facilities, and the creation 
of highly secure systems.

protection and the control of information sharing in multics

the design of mechanisms to control the sharing
of information in the multics system is described. 
 five design principles help provide insight into the
tradeoffs among different possible designs.  the 
key mechanisms described include access control lists,
hierarchical control of access specifications, 
identification and authentication of users, and primary
memory protection.  the paper ends with a discussion 
of several known weaknesses in the current protection mechanism design.

structured multiprogramming

this paper presents a proposal for structured
representation of multiprogramming in a high 
level language.  the notation used explicitly associates
a data structure shared by concurrent processes 
with operations defined on it.  this clarifies the meaning
of programs and permits a large class of time-dependent 
errors to be caught at compile time.  a combination of
critical regions and event variables enables the 
programmer to control scheduling of resources among
competing processes to any degree desired.  these 
concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only within
operating systems but also within user 
************************
 but also within user programs.
