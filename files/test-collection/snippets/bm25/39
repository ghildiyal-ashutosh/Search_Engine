an interactive software system for computers-aided
design:  an application to circuit project

the characteristics of an interactive software system, intended to constitute 
an interface between designer and computer during various steps of
the design process, are presented.  the main emphasis is given to the
description of the features of the two high level user oriented
languages, operating at different levels, on which the interaction
is based.  the first one is imol, an interactive monitor language,
which is designed to perform the overall and control functions
of the software system; its design criteria provide the user with
commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all
the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design.  the second one is

to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications;

a general business-oriented language based on decision expressions*

the structure of a digital compute programming
language which covers a wide class of business 
and file processing applications is presented.  such
a structure, based on identifying and incorporating 
into a compiler the aspects common to all processes
of such class, permits writing extremely compact 
programs, even for comparatively complex applications,
in terms of tables of control expressions which 
express only information characteristic of the particular
application.  furthermore,local changes of 
a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output
files involved) can be effected by local modifications 
in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the
tables).  this structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes. 
 the approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  it stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 it relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are

on the implementation of security measures in information systems

the security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  a set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  the model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.

convert: a high level translation
definition language for data conversion

this paper describes a high level and nonprocedural
translation definition language, convert, 
which provides very powerful and highly flexible data
restructuring capabilities. its design is based 
on the simple underlying concept of a form which enables
the users to visualize the translation processes, 
and thus makes data translation a much simpler task. 
"convert" has been chosen for conveying the purpose 
of the language and should not be confused with any
other language or program bearing the same name.

ended to sequence operators and cumulative operators.  algorithms
are given which use symbol manipulation of matrix expressions so

in the sense that for each expression an equivalent expression

for snobol4.  a block is a three-dimensional 
aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped,
best thought of as a three-dimensional 
extension to a string.  (the third dimension is used for
overstriking.)  blocks may be printed, concatenated 
in any of three dimensions, and merged on the basis
of program-defined connection points.  some blocks 
adapt in size and shape to their environment.  blocks
and their operations are mainly used for composing 
printable output.  a variety of graphical problems (including
flowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams, 
mathematical-equation formation, and text justification
and preparation) have been programmed on a printer 
in what appears to be an easy and natural way.  in addition
to these somewhat specialized applications, 
blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independent
output formation mechanism especially suitable 
for nonnumerical work.  the concept of a block is largely

little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily
be absorbed into the external structure of

automatic data structure choice in a language of very high level

setl is a set-theoretically oriented language
of very high level whose repertoire of semantic 
objects includes finite sets, ordered n-tuples, and
sets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings.  this 
paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this
language.  among other methods of interest, the 
optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion
and membership to be established, the domains 
and ranges of (tabulated) mappings to be estimated from
above and below, and the single-valuedness of 
(tabulated) mappings to be proved.  once facts of this
kind have been established, automatic choice of 
data structures becomes possible. the methods employed
are based upon, and extend, known techniques of 
data flow analysis.

a number of features specifically designed to

logic and programming languages

logic has been long in terested in whether answers
to certain questions are computable in principle, 
since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of
formalization.  more recently, precise comparisons 
in the efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 these, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  what is a machine?
 what is a computable process?  how (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 the definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 so far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  it would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  these levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.

a language extension for expressing constraints on data access

controlled sharing of information is needed and
desirable for many applications and is supported 
in operating systems by access control mechanisms.  this
paper shows how to extend programming languages 
to provide controlled sharing.  the extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 the constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 the approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.

requirements for advanced programming systems for list processing

list processing systems should be designed to
facilitate production of large programs to manipulate 
large complex symbolic data stores.  this paper presents
an overview of a number of system features which 
the author feels are important to improve the productivity
of programmers working in such domains.  a 
system view it taken, rather than focusing just on language
features, since algorithms must be not only 
coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made
efficient, and run on data.  because of this general 
framework,the requirements specified are applicable
to the design of advanced programming systems for 
a wide range of applications.  three aspects of programming
systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  the  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.  syntax directed
input and output of data would facilitate use of 
complex data stores.

 treat computation
over different classes of objects (e.g. 
numbers, strings, labels and functions).  for correct
compilation and execution, the following question 
then arises: is a program properly constructed so that
its operations and operands are compatible?  the 
activity of answering this question is usually called
type checking.  this paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions of abstraction and application of functions. 
in particular, a program is mapped into an expression 
within a decidable subset of the lambda calculus, which
characterizes the type relations within the program 
and eliminates all other information.  the determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".  an application 
to type checking in algol 60 is made, and the attendant
problems faced for any notion of type checking 
are discussed.

answering english questions by computer: a survey

fifteen experimental english language question-answering
systems which are programmed and operating 
are described and reviewed.  the systems range from a conversation
machine to programs which make sentences 
about pictures and systems which translate from english
into logical calculi.  systems are classified 
as list-structured data-based, graphic data-based, text-based
and inferential.  principles and methods 
of operations are detailed and discussed.  it is concluded
that the data-base question-answer has passed 
from initial research into the early developmental
phase.  the most difficult and important research 
questions for the advancement of general-purpose language
processors are seen to be concerned with measuring, 
dealing with ambiguities, translating into formal
languages and searching large tree structures.

the expanding world of computers

the onward sweep of automatic processing of
information is impeded by nine principal barriers: 
geography, cost, problem complexity, man-machine communication,
inadequate sensors, lack of understanding, 
distance, time, and size.  the main incentive for breaching
these barriers is the universal need for 
processing information, ever more urgent as the greater
part of human work activity changes from production 
to service.  computer developments in hardware, programming,
time-sharing, education, data communication, 
and displays are judged by how effectively they remove these
barriers, and their barrier-smashing potentialities 
indicate continued rapid expansion.  problem-oriented
languages are particularly effective 
************************
 are particularly effective over the entire 
front.  online computers and time-sharing also rate high
by this measure.  education and increased understanding 
are basic to all progress with the computer.  this complex
but powerful tool is the most important one 
available to governments and scientists to use in studying
the problems being created by the population 
explosion, and in analyzing possible solutions.

asp is a general purpose associative data
structure package in which an arbitrary number of 
data items and an arbitrary number of the relationships
between these data items may be represented. 
 a special picture language is described which has proved
very useful for drawing asp structures on paper. 
 asp structures are built and manipulated by means
of a series of macro calls, which are outlined in 
the appendix.  emphasis is on the philosophy of the system
rather than a particular implementation, though 
sufficient information is included to enable the
reader to produce his own implementation of asp.

database abstractions: aggregation

aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction
which is important in conceptualizing the real 
world.  aggregation transforms a relationship between
objects into a higher-level object.  a new data 
type, called aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies 
aggregation abstractions.  relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  to main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  it 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  a top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  it is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail, should be incorporated 
into programming languages.

facing future designers are described.  the first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and

further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  this
section also assesses the effect of the data base 
task group proposals.  the final section outlines the

abstraction mechanisms in clu

clu is a new programming language designed to support
the use of abstractions in program construction. 
 work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
 clu provides, in addition to procedures, novel linguistic
mechanisms that support the use of data and 
control abstractions.  this paper provides an in troduction
to the abstraction mechanisms in clu.  by 
means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction 
is illustrated, and it is shown how clu programs may
be written to use and implement abstractions.  the 
clu library, which permits incremental program development
with complete type checking performed at compile

an automatic grading scheme for simple programming exercises

a discussion is given of alterations that were
made to a typical university operating system 
to record the results of programming exercises in three
different languages, including assembly language. 
 in this computer-controlled grading scheme provision
is made for testing with programmer-supplied data 
and for final runs

the structure of programming languages

the following are identified as major components
of every programming language: (1) the elementary 
program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking elementary
statements together, (3) the means by which 
a program can obtain data inputs.  several alternative
forms of each of these components are described, 
compared and evaluated.  many examples, frequently from
list processing languages, 
************************
 processing languages, illustrate the forms 
described.  elementary program statements usually take
the form of commands, requirements, or implicit 
specifications.  a command is an imperative statement
that commands the action to be taken.  a requirement 
describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything
about the actions to be taken.  an implicit 
specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer
must understand what actions will be taken 
to achieve the desired effect.  subroutines may be entered
explicitly, by execute call, or by function 
composition.  explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions.  an execute 
subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction of the programming language. 
 function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call.  the three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to
the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by 
a "name", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means
of variables or functions.  names are useful 
entry points into permanent data structures, but can
be error-causing

, but can
be error-causing distractions in other contexts. 
the author discusses advantages, disadvantages, and factors
influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language.   he concludes by suggesting the evolution
of programming languages toward one which 
will permit all the most convenient ways of structuring
programs, organizing systems, and referencing 
data.

cl-1, an environment for a compiler

a flexible, large-scale programming system to
facilitate the solution of information processing 
problems and to provide intercommunication between programs
and/or programmers has been developed and 
realized on the ibm 709/7090 computer.  the system is
based on a master file concept and has provisions 
for accepting, storing, and retrieving both descriptions
and instances of large and complex data sets, 
as well as algorithms defined on these data sets.  both
data and algorithms may be expressed in a family 
of command and descriptive languages.  the concept
