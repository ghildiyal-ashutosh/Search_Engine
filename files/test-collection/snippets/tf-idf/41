on the optimization of performance of time-sharing systems by simulation

a simulation model 
************************
tion

a simulation model of a time-sharing system
with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite 
auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system
parameters such as store size, number of jobs 
allowed to execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm,
etc.  the effects of these variations on 
a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which
of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  system performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 it is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the

 and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  it appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm

manner

manner and would not benefit from optimization.  features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads,

is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  the comparison 
is found to be very favorable.

interval arithmetic determinant evaluation
and its use in testing for a chebyshev system

two recent papers, one by hansen and one by
hansen and r. r. smith, have shown how interval 
arithmetic (i.) can be used effectively to bound errors
in matrix computations.  in the present paper 
a method proposed by hasen and r. r. smith is compared
with straightforward use of i. in determinant 
evaluation.  computational results show the accuracy
and running times that can be expected when using 
i. for determinant evaluation.  an application using
i. determinants in a program to test a set of 
functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented.

are detected early enough so that they can

a pattern similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructed
in time m x n, where m, n are the dimensions

technique to have an algorithm finding hyperplanes
which separates the two classes in a linearly separable training
set.  the traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates all
points in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered
in the empty space between the two classes.  since a central
hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have
a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better
than a noncentral hyperplane.  six algorithms for finding central
hyperplanes are tested on three data sets.  although frequently

three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be

on the feasibility of voice input to
an on-line computer processing system

an on-line digital computer processing system is considered in which an 
ordinary telephone is the complete terminal device, input to the computer 
being provided as a sequence of spoken words, and output to the user being 
audio responses from the machine.  the feasibility of implementing such a 
system with a fortran-like algebraic compiler as the object processor is 
considered.  details of a specific word recognition program are given.  this 
technique depends on three simplifying restrictions, namely, a "small"
vocabulary set, "known" speakers,

between each input word.  experimental results are presented giving
error rates for different experimental conditions as well as the machine

presented uses the geometric structure of the pattern to define

several applications of this technique in the field of chemistry
are: (1) in pharmacology: searching for a common constellation
of atoms in molecules possessing similar biological activities;
(2) in x-ray crystallography: fitting a structure or a structural fragment
to a set of peaks in the electron-density distribution of

a major problem in picture processing is the
elimination of the large number of spurious regions 
that result from an initial segmentation by region growing
techniques.  such regions have been eliminated 
either on the basis of semantic information or on the
basis of size and contrast.  a scheme is presented 
which performs eliminations on the basis of local properties
of the region adjacency graph.  the scheme 
is based on definitions of graph properties which are
satisfied when a spurious region is present; then 
editing is equivalent to fast graph operations.  a number of examples are shown.

language analysis in the humanities

the use of the computer in the language-oriented
humanities for exhaustive listing of detail 
(as in indices and concordances) is widespread and accepted
as desirable.  the implications of the computer 
for a "science" of the humanities-a science entailing
gathering data for the construction and testing 
of models-are neither widely recognized nor accepted.
 this paper argues that the computer's  major role 
as to language analysis in the humanities will be the
establishing of such a sciencehus, for those 
areas of the humanities for which rigor and precision
are necessary (e.g. analyzing literature or teaching 
a student to write a composition) the computer
can be a critically important facilitator.

performance monitoring in a time-sharing system

a software measurement facility which is part of
a general purpose time-sharing system is described. 
 the date collection facility (dcf) has been implemented
in the michigan terminal system (mts) for the 
system/360 model 67.  it exists for the purpose of monitoring
operating system and user program behavior 
and performance.  the overall structure of mts is outlined
in order to explain the implementation of 
the dcf.  events in the system are identified and recorded
from within the supervisor, and dumped to 
magnetic tape by an auxiliary program for off-line processing.
 events in user programs which are unrelated 
to system actions are recorded with a supervisor call.
 the time of occurrence of each event is accurately 
recorded, and data items are further identified by job and
type.  the overhead associated with data collection 
and its interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed,
and both are shown to be minimal.  several 
examples are given of information obtained with the
facility and of applications in which it has been 
useful.  some general guidelines are offered for
the construction of future monitoring programs.

the set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern
