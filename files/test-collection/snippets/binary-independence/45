performance of height-balanced trees

this paper presents the results of simulations
that investigate the performance of height-balanced 
(hb[k]) trees.  it is shown that the only statistic
of hb[1] trees (avl trees) that is a function of 
the size of the tree is the time to search for an item
in the tree.  for sufficiently large trees, the 
execution times of all procedures for maintaining hb[1]
trees are independent of the size of the tree. 
 in particular, an average of .465 restructures are required
per insertion, with an average of 2.78 nodes 
revisited to restore the hb[1] property; an average of
 .214 restructures are required per deletion, with 
an average of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the hb[1]
property.  moreover,the execution times of procedures 
for maintaining hb[k] trees, for k>1, are also independent
of the size of the tree except for the average 
number of nodes revisited on a delete operation in
order to restore the hb[k] property on trace back. 
 the cost of maintaining hb[k] trees drops sharply as the
allowable imbalance (k) increases.  both analytical 
and experimental results that show the cost of maintaining
hb[k] trees as a function of k are discussed.

the next 700 programming languages 

a family of unimplemented computing languages
is described that is intended to span differences 
of application area by a unified framework.  this framework
dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined 
names, and the conventions about characterizing functional
relationships.  within this framework the 
design of a specific language splits into two independent
parts.  one is the choice of written appearances 
of programs (or more generally, their physical representation).
 the other is the choice of the abstract 
entities (such as numbers, character-strings, lists
of them, functional relations among them) that can 
be referred to in the language.  the system is biased
towards "expressions" rather than "statements." 
 it includes a nonprocedural(purely

a nonrecursive method of syntax specification

the use of the kleene regular expression notation
for describing algebraic language syntax, 
in particular of algol, is described in this paper. 
a fortran ii computer program for carrying out the 
elimination algorithm of gorn,similar to gaussian elimination
for linear systems of algebraic equations, 
is described.  this was applied to numerous smaller
languages, including some sublanguage of algol.  
a hand calculation result of the application of the algorithm
to all of algol is given, thus expressing 
the revised algol 1960 syntax in completely nonrecursive
terms, as far as its context-free portion is 
concerned.  this description in many ways is far more
intuitively understood than the previous recursive 
description, it is suggested.  the paper also includes
results of the machine

recursive data structures in apl

a mathematical study of three approaches for defining nested
arrays in apl is presented.  theorems exhibiting the relationships
between the definitional systems are given and illustrated through graph
representations.  one of the approaches is used to define an
apl array to be a recursive data structure equivalent to a tree structure
in which all data is stored at the leaves as homogeneous
arrays of numbers and characters.  an extension of apl is proposed that
includes new primitive functions to manipulate the nesting
level of arrays and new operators to assist in the
construction of data-driven algorithms.

automatic derivation of microsentences

the decomposition of long complex english sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language 
************************
 of natural 
language messages.  to explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the harvard multipath analysis program.  the basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  a program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 the authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems, they may have

 of information are described.  this method is particularly
suitable for queries requesting a group of information items,
 all of which possess a particular set of attributes (and possibly
some other attributes as well).  several examples are given; the
results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space
are compared to other common approaches.  algorithms evaluating
the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system
are described.  for a certain class of information systems,
the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval

with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems.  
moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted

dynamic document processing

the current role of computers in automatic
document processing is briefly outlined, and some 
reasons are given why the early promise of library automation
and of the mechanization of documentation 
processes has not been fulfilled.  a new dynamic document
environment is then outlined in which clustered
files are searched and information is retrieved following
an interactive user-controlled search process. 
 methods are described for an automatic query modification
based on user needs, and for a continuous 
reorganization of the stored information as a function of
earlier file processing and of normal collection 
growth.  the proposed procedures provide powerful tools
for information retrieval and for the control 
of dynamic library collections in which new items
are continually added and old ones are retired.

multiprogram scheduling parts 1 and 2.  introduction and theory*

in order to exploit fully a fast computer which
possesses simultaneous processing abilities, 
it should to a large extent schedule its own workload.
 the scheduling routine must be capable of extremely 
rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating.
 the construction of a schedule entails determining 
which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially
with respect to each other.  a concise 
scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize
the time for executing the entire pending workload 
(or any subset of it), subject to external
