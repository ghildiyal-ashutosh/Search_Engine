dynamic storage allocation systems in many recent computer system designs hardware facilities have been provided for easing the problems of storage allocation a method of characterizing dynamic storage allocation systems according to the functional capabilities provided and the underlying techniques used is presented the basic purpose of the paper is to provide a useful perspective from which the utility of various hardware facilities may be assessed a brief survey of storage allocation facilities in several representative computer systems is included as an appendix cacm may 1968 randell b kuehner c j segmentation paging multiprogramming storage allocation storage management virtual memories storage fragmentation storage hierarchies addressing mechanisms 4 30 6 20 ca680502 jb february 23 1978 9 49 am 1754 4 1754 1754 4 1754 2358 4 1754 488 4 1754 274 5 1754 1754 5 1754 1754 5 1754 1754 5 1754 1879 5 1754 1884 5 1754 1901 5 1754 376 5 1754 2095 5 1754 2277 5 1754 2297 5 1754 2365 5 1754 168 6 1754 185 6 1754 987 6 1754 1728 6 1754 1728 6 1754 1751 6 1754 1751 6 1754 1751 6 1754 1754 6 1754 1754 6 1754 1754 6 1754 1754 6 1754 1754 6 1754 1754 6 1754 1754 6 1754 1879 6 1754 1924 6 1754 2362 6 1754
