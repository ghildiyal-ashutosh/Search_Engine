increasing the efficiency of quicksort a method is presented for the analysis of various generalizations of quicksort the average asymptotic number of comparisons needed is shown to be an log 2 n a formula is derived expressing a in terms of the probability distribution of the bound of a partition this formula assumes a particularly simple form for a generalization already considered by hoare namely choice of the bound as median of a random sample the main contribution of this paper is another generalization of quicksort which uses a bounding interval instead of a single element as bound this generalization turns out to be easy to implement in a computer program a numerical approximation shows that a 1 140 for this version of quicksort compared with 1 386 for the original this implies a decrease in number of comparisons of 18 percent actual tests showed about 15 percent saving in computing time cacm september 1970 van emden m h sorting quicksort information content entropy distribution of median 3 73 4 49 5 31 5 6 ca700908 jb february 10 1978 10 15 am 1175 4 1997 1919 4 1997 1969 4 1997 1997 4 1997 1997 4 1997 2191 4 1997 2216 4 1997 2388 4 1997 2679 4 1997 2679 4 1997 3054 4 1997 3054 4 1997 3121 4 1997 1969 5 1997 1997 5 1997 1997 5 1997 1997 5 1997 308 5 1997 2216 5 1997 2679 5 1997 3054 5 1997 864 6 1997 970 6 1997 1175 6 1997 1175 6 1997 1190 6 1997 1228 6 1997 1880 6 1997 1919 6 1997 1919 6 1997 1969 6 1997 1969 6 1997 1969 6 1997 1980 6 1997 1997 6 1997 1997 6 1997 1997 6 1997 307 6 1997 308 6 1997 308 6 1997 309 6 1997 2017 6 1997 2042 6 1997 2679 6 1997 3187 6 1997 507 6 1997 716 6 1997 776 6 1997 783 6 1997
