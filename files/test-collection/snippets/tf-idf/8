secure communications over insecure channels

according to traditional conceptions of cryptographic
security, it is necessary to transmit 
a key, by secret means, before encrypted messages can
be sent securely.  this paper shows that it is 
possible to select a key over open communications channels
in such a fashion that communications security 
can be maintained.  a method is described which forces
any enemy to expend an amount of work which increases 
as the square of the work required of the two communicants
to select the key.  the method provides a 
logically new kind of protection against the passive
eaves dropper.  it suggests that further research 
on this topic will be highly rewarding, both
in a theoretical and a practical sense.

a user authentication scheme not requiring secrecy in the computer

in many computer operating systems a user authenticates

************************
 a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system.  the system compares
this password with one recorded in a password 
table which is available to only the authentication
program.  the integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret.  in this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer.    all aspects of the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  the scheme is based
on using a function h which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  this function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  the intruder may know all about h and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert h to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  this paper discusses
issues surrounding selection of a suitable h.  two 
different plausible arguments are given that penetration
would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then 
argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.  finally,
some human engineering problems relating to 
the scheme are discussed.

reverse path forwarding of broadcast packets

a broadcast packet is for delivery to all
nodes of a network.  algorithms for accomplishing 
this delivery through a store-and-forward packet switching
 computer network include (1) transmission 
of separately addressed packets. (2) multidestination
addressing, (3) hot potato forwarding,(4) spanning 
tree forwarding, and (5) source based forwarding.  to
this list of algorithms we add (6) reverse path 
forwarding, a broadcast routing method which exploits
routing procedures and data structures already 
available for packet switching.  reverse path forwarding
is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing 
 in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks.
 the algorithm is described

 the algorithm is described as being practical 
 because it is not optimal according to metrics developed

it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity

considerations in the design of a multiple
computer system with extended core storage

the use of large quantities of addressable
(but not executable) fast random access memory to 
heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer system
is discussed.  the general design 
of the hardware arrangement and the software components
and functions of such a system are based on a 
planned configuration of dual cdc 6600's that share one
million words of extended core storage.  in the 
generalization of such a design, special emphasis is
placed on estimating expected gains when compared 
with the traditional configuration of separate and independent
computers without extended core storage. 
 an observation is made on the use of conventional, slower
speed, random access storage devices in place 
of the faster memory.

the security of an information system may be

dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security

security features of several existing systems, and serves

the design, implementation, and evaluation of a working set dispatcher

the behavior of a computer system is largely
dependent upon the algorithms employed to allocate 
the system resources to the processes competing for them.
 recent research in time-sharing paging systems 
has developed the working set model for program behavior,
and are source allocation strategy based on 
this model has been proposed.  two implementations
along these principles have been reported, but it 
seems that in neither case have further results been
announced.  this report discusses the design and 
implementation of a dispatcher based on the working set
principle, presents data to permit analysis of 
its behavior, and indicates future directions of research
on methods of controlling a computer system.

a modular computer sharing system

an alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  the system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  one of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  in the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  a crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 the ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 this system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that

a position paper on computing and communications

the effective operation of free enterprise in
creating the envisioned information service industry 
is dependent upon three accomplishments: (1) the restructuring
of our information processing industry 
so that a clear division of costs is made among computing,
communications, and the development of information 
services; (2) the wide use of multiaccess system concepts
so that information services may share in the 
use of computer installations and so that the cost of their
construction is reasonable; and (3) the development 
of public, message-switched communications services so
that adequate provisions are made for information 
security.

on quadratic adaptive routing algorithms

two analytic models of a store-and-forward communications
network are constructed, one to find 
the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate
the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained 
by an adaptive routing algorithm.  these models show that
adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  the form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  the modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  simulation results are presented 
which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.

dynamic verification of operating system decisions

dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  the dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the prime system
being designed and constructed at the university 
of california, berkeley.  prime is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 the technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  on prime,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

the use of interactive graphics to solve numerical problems

with the advent of on-line (time-sharing) computer systems
and graphic terminals, we have available a new dimension
in numerical problem solving capabilities.  rather than simply use
the new power to achieve fast turnaround, we can develop interactive
routines which are easy to use and also take advantage of the
insight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver.  several
on-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving
have already been implemented as well as some special purpose
systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary
differential equations.  the advantage of restricting the problem
area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified.
in this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such
systems and design considerations for interactive routines.

display unit under operating system/360.  adept 
is a cataloged program that controls the standard operating
system by terminating and rescheduling itself 
automatically, relinquishing computer resources allocated
to it, and surrendering control to the operating 
system to perform other jobs.  it expands the power
and flexibility of computer-assisted instruction 
by making immediately available to students, teachers,
and other users, the full resources (system-cataloged 
programs) of the operating system.  language processors

introduction to "feature analysis of
generalized data base management systems"

this paper is a separately published introduction
to a main report which analyzes the features 
of generalized data base management systems.  this introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  after some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  the first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  the problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned,

this paper describes a system for full-duplex
communication between a time-shared computer 
and its terminals.  the system consists of a communications
computer directly connected to the time-shared 
system, a number of small remote computers to which
the terminals are attached, and connecting medium 
speed telephone lines.  it can service a large number
of terminals of various types.  the overall system 
design is presented along with the algorithms used to
solve three specific problems: local echoing, error

************************
s of large and active digital systems 
is described.  essential objectives sought are improved
ease and economy in model generation, economy 
in execution time and space, and a facility for handling
simultaneous activities.  the main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities.  the passage of
time is simulated in a precise, quantitative fashion 
and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous
and asynchronous logic.  certain aspects 
of the techniques described may be used for the simulation
of network structures other than digital networks.

three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debugging

the designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  these criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  to define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

a correctness proof of a topology information
main tenance protocol for a distributed computer 
network

in order for the nodes of a distributed computer
network to communicate, each node must have 
information about the network's topology.  since nodes
and links sometimes crash, a scheme is needed 
to update this information.  one of the major constrain ts
on such a topology information scheme is that 
it may not involve a central controller.  the topology
information protocol that was implemented on the 
merit computer network is presented and explained; this
protocol is quite general and could be implemented 
on any computer network.  it is based on baran's "hot
potato heuristic routing doctrine."  a correctness 
proof of this topology information protocol is also presented.

if the ultimate aim of a computing network
is resource sharing, then the human component as 
well as the technical component of networking must
be fully investigated to achieve this goal.  this 
research is a first step toward assisting the user in participating
in the vast store of resources available 
on a network. analytical, simulation, and statistical performance
evaluation tools are employed to investigate 
the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitor
that is capable of providing comparative response 
time information for users wishing to process various
computing applications at some network computing 
node.  the research clearly reveals that sufficient
system data are currently obtainable, at least for 
the five diverse arpa network systems studied in detail,
to describe and predict the response time for 
network time-sharing systems as it depends on some
measure of system activity or load level.
