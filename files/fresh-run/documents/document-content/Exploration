exploration is the act of searching for the purpose of discovery of information or resources exploration occurs in all non sessile animal species including humans in human history its most dramatic rise was during the age of discovery when european explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons since then major explorations after the age of discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery in scientific research exploration is one of three purposes of empirical research the other two being description and explanation the term is often used metaphorically for example an individual may speak of exploring the internet sexuality etc the phoenicians 1550 bce 300 bce traded throughout the mediterranean sea and asia minor though many of their routes are still unknown today the presence of tin in some phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to britain according to virgil s aeneid and other ancient sources the legendary queen dido was a phoenician from tyre who sailed to north africa and founded the city of carthage hanno the navigator 500 bc a carthaginean navigator explored the western coast of africa the romans organized expeditions to cross the sahara desert with five different routes all these expeditions were supported by legionaries and had mainly a commercial purpose only the one done by emperor nero seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of ethiopia or nubia in 62 ad two legionaries explored the sources of the nile river one of the main reasons of the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it 1 the explorations near the african western and eastern coasts were supported by roman ships and deeply related to the naval commerce mainly toward the indian ocean romans organized several explorations also in northern europe and as far as asia up to china during the 2nd century bc the han dynasty explored much of the eastern northern hemisphere starting in 139 bc the han diplomat zhang qian traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the da yuezhi against the xiongnu the yuezhi had been evicted from gansu by the xiongnu in 177 bc however zhang s travels discovered entire countries which the chinese were unaware of including the remnants of the conquests of alexander the great r 336 323 bc 2 when zhang returned to china in 125 bc he reported on his visits to dayuan fergana kangju sogdiana and daxia bactria formerly the greco bactrian kingdom which had just been subjugated by the da yuezhi 3 zhang described dayuan and daxia as agricultural and urban countries like china and although he did not venture there described shendu the indus river valley of northwestern india and anxi arsacid territories further west 4 from about 800 ad to 1040 ad the vikings explored europe and much of the western northern hemisphere via rivers and oceans for example it is known that the norwegian viking explorer erik the red 950 1003 sailed to and settled in greenland after being expelled from iceland while his son the icelandic explorer leif ericson 980 1020 reached newfoundland and the nearby north american coast and is believed to be the first european to land in north america polynesians were a maritime people who populated and explored the central and south pacific for around 5 000 years up to about 1280 when they discovered new zealand the key invention to their exploration was the outrigger canoe which provided a swift and stable platform for carrying goods and people based on limited evidence it is thought that the voyage to new zealand was deliberate it is unknown if one or more boats went to new zealand or the type of boat or the names of those who migrated 2011 studies at wairau bar in new zealand show a high probability that one origin was ruahine island in the society islands polynesians may have used the prevailing north easterly trade winds to reach new zealand in about three weeks the cook islands are in direct line along the migration path and may have been an intermediate stopping point there are cultural and language similarities between cook islanders and new zealand maori early maori had different legends of their origins but the stories were misunderstood and reinterpreted in confused written accounts by early european historians in new zealand trying to present a coherent pattern of maori settlement in new zealand mathematical modelling based on dna genome studies using state of the art techniques have shown that a large number of polynesian migrants 100 200 including women arrived in new zealand around the same time in about 1280 otago university studies have tried to link distinctive dna teeth patterns which show special dietary influence with places in or nearby the society islands 5 the chinese explorer wang dayuan fl 1311 1350 made two major trips by ship to the indian ocean during 1328 1333 he sailed along the south china sea and visited many places in southeast asia and reached as far as south asia landing in sri lanka and india then in 1334 1339 he visited north africa and east africa later the chinese admiral zheng he 1371 1433 made seven voyages to arabia east africa india indonesia and thailand the age of discovery also known as the age of exploration is one of the most important periods of geographical exploration in human history it started in the early 15th century and lasted until the 17th century in that period europeans discovered and or explored vast areas of the americas africa asia and oceania portugal and spain dominated the first stages of exploration while other european nations followed such as england netherlands and france important explorations during this period went to a number of continents and regions around the globe in africa important explorers of this period include diogo c o c 1452 c 1486 who discovered and ascended the congo river and reached the coasts of the present day angola and namibia bartolomeu dias c 1450 1500 who was the first european to reach the cape of good hope and other parts of the south african coast explorers of routes from europe towards asia the indian ocean and the pacific ocean include vasco da gama 1460 1524 a navigator who made the first trip from europe to india and back by the cape of good hope discovering the ocean route to the east pedro alvares cabral c 1467 68 c 1520 who following the path of gama claimed brazil and led the first expedition that linked europe africa america and asia diogo dias who discovered the eastern coast of madagascar and rounded the corner of africa explorers such as diogo fernandes pereira and pedro mascarenhas 1470 1555 among others who discovered and mapped the mascarene islands and other archipelagos ant nio de abreu c 1480 c 1514 and francisco serr o 14 1521 led the first direct european fleet into the pacific ocean on its western edges through the sunda islands reaching the moluccas andres de urdaneta 1498 1568 discovered the maritime route from asia to the americas in the pacific ocean jorge de menezes c 1498 discovered papua new guinea garc a jofre de loa sa 1490 1526 discovered the marshall islands explorations of the americas began with the initial discovery of america by christopher columbus 1451 1506 who led a castilian spanish expedition across the atlantic discovering america after the discovery of america by columbus a number of important expeditions were sent out to explore the western hemisphere this included juan ponce de le n 1474 1521 who discovered and mapped the coast of florida vasco n ez de balboa c 1475 1519 who was the first european to view the pacific ocean from american shores after crossing the isthmus of panama confirming that america was a separate continent from asia aleixo garcia 14 1527 who explored the territories of present day southern brazil paraguay and bolivia crossing the chaco and reaching the andes near sucre lvar n ez cabeza de vaca 1490 1558 discovered the mississippi river and was the first european to sail the gulf of mexico and cross texas jacques cartier 1491 1557 drew the first maps of part of central and maritime canada francisco v zquez de coronado 1510 1554 discovered the grand canyon and the colorado river francisco de orellana 1511 1546 was the first european to navigate the length of the amazon river ferdinand magellan 1480 1521 was the first navigator to cross the pacific ocean discovering the strait of magellan the tuamotus and mariana islands and achieving a nearly complete circumnavigation of the earth in multiple voyages for the first time juan sebastian elcano 1476 1526 completed the first global circumnavigation in the second half of the 16th century and the 17th century exploration of asia and the pacific ocean continued with explorers such as andr s de urdaneta 1498 1568 who discovered the maritime route from asia to the americas pedro fernandes de queir s 1565 1614 who discovered the pitcairn islands and the vanuatu archipelago lvaro de menda a 1542 1595 who discovered the tuvalu archipelago the marquesas the solomon islands and wake island explorers of australia included willem janszoon 1570 1630

explored the great lakes region of the united states and canada and the entire length of the mississippi river long after the golden age of discovery other explorers completed the world map such as various russians explorers reaching the siberian pacific coast and the bering strait at the extreme edge of asia and alaska north america vitus bering 1681 1741 who in the service of the russian navy explored the bering strait the bering sea the north american coast of alaska and some other northern areas of the pacific ocean and james cook who explored the east coast of australia the hawaiian islands and circumnavigated the antarctic continent there were still significant explorations which occurred well into the modern age this includes the lewis and clark expedition 1804 1806 an overland expedition dispatched by president thomas jefferson to explore the newly acquired louisiana purchase and to find an interior aquatic route to the pacific ocean along with other objectives to examine the flora and fauna of the continent the united states exploring expedition 1838 1842 was an expedition sent by president andrew jackson in order to survey the pacific ocean and surrounding lands with the advent of satellite imagery and aviation exploration of earth has largely ceased however the culture of many disconnected tribes still remain undocumented and left to be explored humanity is continuing to follow the impulse to explore moving beyond earth space exploration started in the 20th century with the invention of exo atmospheric rockets this has given humans the opportunity to travel to the moon and to send robotic explorers to other planets and far beyond both of the voyager probes have left the solar system bearing imprinted gold discs with multiple data types a 2015 study performed on mobile phone data and on gps tracks of private vehicles in italy demonstrated that individuals naturally split into two well defined categories according to their mobility habits dubbed returners and explorers 6 explorers showed a star like mobility pattern they have a central core of locations composed by home and work places around which distant core of locations gravitates
