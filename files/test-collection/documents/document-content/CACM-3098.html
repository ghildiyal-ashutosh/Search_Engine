computer generation of gamma random variables a new method for generating random variables from the gamma distribution with nonintegral shape parameter a is proposed this method is similar to two other methods recently given by wallace and fishman it is compared with fishman s and ahrens and dieter s methods the core storage requirements and programming effort for this method are similar to those of fishman s method the proposed method is the same as fishman s method for 1 a 2 and is faster than fishman s method for 3 a 19 also the proposed method is much simpler than ahrens and dieter s method and is faster for a 8 cacm may 1978 tadikamalla p gamma variables rejection method computer methods 5 5 8 1 ca780509 dh february 26 1979 1 10 pm 2847 4 3098 2928 4 3098 3046 4 3098 3046 4 3098 3098 4 3098 3098 4 3098 3107 4 3098 2569 5 3098 2847 5 3098 3046 5 3098 3098 5 3098 3098 5 3098 3098 5 3098 2569 6 3098 2847 6 3098 3098 6 3098
