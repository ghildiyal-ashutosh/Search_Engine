on the time required for a sequence of matrix products this paper discusses the multiplication of conformable sequences of row vectors column vectors and square matrices the minimum time required to evaluate such products on ordinary serial computers as well as parallel computers is discussed algorithms are presented which properly parse such matrix sequences subject to the constraints of the machine organization cacm january 1973 muraoka y kuck d j matrix expressions matrix multiplication operation minimization parallel machine time minimization 4 22 5 14 ca730104 jb january 24 1978 4 41 pm 1614 4 2557 2253 4 2557 2557 4 2557 2557 5 2557 2557 5 2557 2557 5 2557 437 5 2557 3075 5 2557 3085 5 2557 2289 6 2557 2557 6 2557 2557 6 2557 2664 6 2557 2714 6 2557
