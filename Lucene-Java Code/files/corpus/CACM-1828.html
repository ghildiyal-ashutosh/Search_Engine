synchronization in a parallel accessed data base the following problem is considered given a data base which can be manipulated simultaneously by more than one process what are the rules for synchronization which will maximize the amount of parallel activity allowed it is assumed that the data base can be represented as a graph an example of such a data base is a hierarchy of directories for an on line file system methods for synchronization of processes are examined their validity is discussed and their performance compared cacm november 1969 shoshani a bernstein a j parallel accessing parallel search file search data base synchronization locking deadlock 3 73 3 74 4 32 ca691102 jb february 15 1978 1 13 pm 1805 4 1828 1828 4 1828 1828 4 1828 1854 4 1828 1854 4 1828 1877 4 1828 1960 4 1828 2150 4 1828 2187 4 1828 2317 4 1828 2319 4 1828 2377 4 1828 2342 4 1828 2376 4 1828 2379 4 1828 2424 4 1828 2482 4 1828 2618 4 1828 2632 4 1828 2704 4 1828 2723 4 1828 2738 4 1828 2740 4 1828 2741 4 1828 2867 4 1828 3184 4 1828 1748 5 1828 1749 5 1828 1828 5 1828 1828 5 1828 1828 5 1828
